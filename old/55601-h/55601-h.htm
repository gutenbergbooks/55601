<h2 class="nobreak">AUTHOR'S PREFACE.</h2></div>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> contents of this book have, hitherto,
never been printed nor published.
One chapter among them, <i>The Provider</i>,
is based very literally on a tragic thing
which happened, some years ago, in Dublin,
and which, figuring as a cable despatch
of some ten lines in a Boston daily
newspaper, fell under my eye, to be remembered,
and afterwards cast into its
present form. In the September (1895)
number of <i>Harpers' Magazine</i>, little Father
Time and his adopted brother, in
<i>Hearts Insurgent</i>, end their innocent lives
from Hughey's strange motive, though
not in his manner. It is perhaps worth
while to state that my story was finished
and laid by, prior to the appearance of
the novel in its serial form, lest I should
seem fain to melt my waxen wings in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[Pg vi]</a></span>
fire of the Wessex sun. It is possible
that the actual incident had come to Mr.
Hardy's notice also, and with a keen and
pitiful interest for so expert a student of
human nature. A curious circumstance
in his relation of it is that the elder child,
in order that there may be more room in
a hard world for the persons he loves, disposes
not only of himself, but presumably
of the younger child as well; and in the
original version of my story Hughey
jumped into the river with his sister
Nora in his arms. But a friend of mine,
who read the manuscript in 1894, a
writer of great insight whose opinion I
value in the extreme, so wrought with me
to change the cruel ending, that I did so
then and there, after some argument, and
sent the boy of "long, long thoughts"
uncompanied to his fate. The point of
all this is, of course, that I now perceive
my small invention had dared, unconsciously,
to keep yet closer pace than
would appear with Mr. Hardy's; for the
suicide of real life was the suicide of one
child alone.</p>

<p>The other three sketches here are more
imaginative; and the first of them, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vii" id="Page_vii">[Pg vii]</a></span>
bears the earliest date, was, from end to
end, a dream, and is somewhat reluctantly
included. They stand for apprentice-work
in fiction, and are my only
attempts of that kind.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Though</span> his curate was away, the incumbent
of Orrinleigh, my kind Cyril
Nasmith, had thrown aside his everlasting
scrolls and folios, and spent the whole
morning out-of-doors with me. We had
been over the castle park and gallery, and
even into the dairy, and thence up the
path by a trout-stream to the site of a
Saxon city; and Nasmith had been enthusiastically
educating me all the way.
I knew that there was little enough for
him to do meanwhile. His village sheep
were very tame and white; and his other
sheep, at the manor, all wild and black:
theology seemed to fall rather flat between
them. So, by the dispensation of Providence,
in his work-day leisure he had
relapsed into the one intellectual passion
of his life, archæology: a wise, worshipping
sort of man, and the prince of Anglican
antiquaries. As for me, he loved<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span>
me better than ever when he found what
genuine interest I took in his quiet hidden
corner of &mdash;&mdash;shire, whither I came
from London to pass a memorable night
and day with him, after a sixteen years'
separation; for his boyhood had been
spent in my own Maryland, his mother's
family being Americans. It was a little
sober, pastoral place, this Orrinleigh, with
its straw-browed cottages bosomed in roses,
sitting all in a row upon the overshaded
lane, and, from the height where we stood,
looking like so many sepia-tinted mushrooms
in the broad green world. Just
beyond us, in the near neighborhood of
Orrinleigh House, the gray sham-Grecian
porch of his ritualistic Tudor church
skulked in the faint May sun. "What
do you call that?" I said. "It is the
one ugly thing hereabouts." He smiled.
"Of course it is ugly, structurally," he
answered in an apologetic tone; "Saint
Ruth's was built in King James the
First's time; I do not pride myself on
that. But you should see the ruin, Holden!
a darling bit of Early Decorated.
Walk over there now with me. We have
the time to give; and it is only a couple<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span>
of miles away." And off he started at
his brisk bachelor pace, fixing his shovel-hat
well on his forehead, for we were in
the teeth of the inland breeze. "This
enormity," I remarked, casting a sportive
thumb over my shoulder, "has an odd
name: Saint Ruth's." He corrected me
in his most amiable fashion. "The title
is not unique; and it has every precedent,
pre-Christian as it is. Have you never
heard, good sceptic, of Saint Joachim?
nay, of Saint Michael, another person
who might have proved an <i>alibi</i> if he ever
came up for Roman canonization? Besides,
the name has ancient local sanction.
This Saint Ruth's-on-the-Hill continues
the dedication of the other to which we
are going: Lovers' Saint Ruth's." "Lovers'
Saint Ruth's?" I exclaimed, keen at
the scent. "Come now, Nasmith, there's
some legend back of that; you know
there is. Let us have it." And that is
how I heard the story.</p>

<p>He told it not without reluctance, as
if it were a precious thing he could not
easily part with, even to an old friend.
All along the road, as we went between
the pleasant farm-lands, stepping over<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
golden pools of primroses between the
wheel-tracks, little silences broke into
his talk. Nasmith's heart is truly in the
past; and humbly happy indeed it keeps
him. We had been through the gallery
before breakfast, and he reminded me of
it, by way of prelude. "Do you remember
how pleased you were with the great
Vandyck on the east wall?" The grouped
portrait of a blonde man, a blonde woman,
and a child unlike either; how
beautiful it was! the two unforgettable
melancholy faces contrasting oddly with
the ruddy dark-eyed boy in a yellow
doublet, playing with his dog before them
on the floor.</p>

<p>"Well, you saw there the Lord Richard,
and his wife, the Lady Eleanor. He
was the third Earl's only son, born in the
year 1606. The house of Orrinleigh was
founded by his grand-uncle, on murder
and fraud. Richard, almost the only
Langham with a conscience, had it in
too great a degree, and grew up, one
knows not why, with a diseased sense of
impending retribution; and, therefore,
when misfortune for a while overwhelmed
him and his, it found him not unprepared.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>
His mother was a Neville; he
had great prospects and possessions.
Lady Eleanor was a sweet lass of honorable
blood, a good squire's daughter,
and the youngest of a family of eight.
She belonged over there in Frambleworth,
where you see the twin spires. From
boyhood and girlhood these two clung
to each other. I wonder if one ever
sees such fast love now-a-days: so simple,
so deep, so long-suffering, all made
of rapture and grief! They were betrothed
early, with a kiss given under
the shadow of the king yew in the old
church-yard; they both cherished the
place to the end, and there lies their dust.
You see, the original Saint Ruth's was a
monastic chapel; and it was stripped, and
left to fall to pieces, by the greed of the
rascally Reformers, (excuse me; that's
what I must call them!" muttered my
filial High Churchman), "and it was
nearly as much of a ruin in Lord Richard's
youth as it is to-day. For a whole generation,
Orrinleigh had no Christian services
at all, and dropped into less than
paganism; for which nobody seemed to
care, until the architectural hodge-podge<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
on the hill was raised by the old Earl,
and the people were gradually gathered in
to learn all about a new code of moral
beauty from the nakedest, dullest, and
vulgarest object in the three kingdoms.
As I was saying, the two young people
made their tryst by the priory wall,
secretly, as it had to be; for the Earl
would not hear of penniless Eleanor
Thurlocke for his heir's bride; and the
squire, a staunch Elizabethan Protestant,
favored young Kit Brimblecombe, or his
cousin Austin, for her suitor, and held
aloof from the Lord Richard, whom he
suspected of having reclaimed his ancestors'
faith and become a Papist, while at
Oxford. That, as it happened, was true
enough; and, moreover, the girl herself
had followed her lover back into the old
religion: so that there were disadvantage
and danger of all kinds, in those days,
behind them and before. The little
church meant much to them both, the
pathetic ghost of what had been so famous
and fair. There they used to meet,
when luck served, for what great comfort
they could still reap out of their narrowing
lives, shedding tears on each other's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
breasts over that outlook which seemed
so cruelly hopeless. But a terrible tragedy
broke up and changed their youth,
and it was at Lovers' Saint Ruth's that
it happened.</p>

<p>"Eleanor was barely past eighteen, and
Richard not one-and-twenty. It was
spring twilight, when he rode down alone
to the valley, galloping, because, for once,
he was a little late to meet his maid. She
also had started on foot, across the dewy
field-path from Frambleworth, having for
company part of the way an old market-woman
and her goodman, who would not
have betrayed the object of her journey
for worlds. They left her at the lonely
cross-roads, whence she gayly took her
way west, with Orrinleigh Church, as it
was still called, almost in sight. The
next morning their bodies were found,
not fifty rods away; and it is clear to me,
that, hearing Eleanor's first stifled call,
they had turned back to her rescue, and
so perished at the hands of the wicked.
With whom the guilt lay, none ever
knew; the blame was laid upon the gypsies,
I think unjustly, and three of them
were hanged on these very downs. It was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
a wild time; and desperate men, singly,
or in bands, mad for food and plunder,
and reeling drunk from cellar to cellar,
were over this peaceful county. The
squire's ewe lamb, whom, in his senses,
a devil might have spared with a blessing
on her sweet looks, was foully waylaid,
and worse than murdered. In the face of
agony and humiliation, her spirit fainted
away. Hours later, when all was still,
and the dazzling moon was up over the
sycamores, Eleanor Thurlocke awoke,
and, with her last spasmodical strength,
dragged herself to the end of the lane,
and on to the hollow stone step of the
church, to die. It was past midnight.
Who should be within those crumbling
walls, even then, but her own Richard,
kneeling in his satin dress, with a lighted
hand-lamp by his side, his brow raised to
Heaven? He had missed her; and he
knew not what to think for disappointment
and anxious love; and, sleep being
far from him, there had he waited until
now before the fallen altar-stone where
they had so often prayed together. As
dejectedly he swung back the outer door,
he saw his dear, her thick gold locks unbound,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
her vesture in disorder, her hands
chilled and bleeding from the stony travel
and the briers. Without a question, for
he was ever a ready courageous lad, he
put out the lantern, and cast it under a
bush; and, gathering Eleanor into his
strong arms, first making the sign of the
cross upon her brow, he climbed the hill
slowly, steadily, and bore her straight
into Orrinleigh House, and into his dead
mother's chamber. He made no sound;
but he left her long enough to get restoratives,
and then hurried back, and laid her
tenderly in the high-canopied bed there,
radiant in the moonshine; and, keeping
his own heart smothered, so that it could
utter no least cry, placed the door ajar,
and began to pace, soft as a tiger, to and
fro, to and fro, to and fro, outside.
When the white of dawn appeared, he
crept in and crouched low beside the pillows.
She opened her eyes, and, with
his haggard cheek close to hers, stammered
to him, piteously, as best she
could, her knowledge of what had befallen.
He did not speak nor move for
a long while, partly because he feared so
for her jarred mind. But he knew the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
house would be stirring with the day, and
events lay in his hands. It was a strange,
inconsistent thing, but entirely in harmony
with the Lord Richard's fatalistic
character, that neither then, nor ever after,
would he proclaim the true fact. To
save her from certain slander, to wall her
in with reparation on every side, was his
one passionate impulse. He knew that
having carried her by night to Orrinleigh,
he must bear the burden of his own deed.
He made his resolve to explain nothing,
for her sake, and to act as became the
overmastering affection he had for her.
He breathed quickly and firmly in her
ear: 'Nell!' She smiled faintly at
him. 'Nell, darling, this must be our
bridal-morn.' A low groan, such as
made him shiver like the air around a
fire, was her only answer; such a heart-rending
groan of pure unreasoning horror
as his ears had never heard. But he
could not flinch now; the morn was
breaking, fresh and undelayed, over his
altered world. With the still force which
was in him, and which, from his boyhood,
could compel every one he knew, the
Lord Richard said: 'Yes.' 'Yes!' she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
echoed, after a while, as if in a weary
dream, and fell unconscious again. Then
he rose, and called old Stephen Bowles,
the servant whom he could best trust,
and despatched him, on his own horse,
ere the sun was up, for a priest eleven
miles away. And there, in his dead
mother's chamber, with one only witness,
and in such wretchedness, the two were
hastily wed, Eleanor lying quietly, since
they dared not raise her, and the hope of
Orrinleigh kneeling with his curly bronze
head buried in her white little hands.
When the others had gone, for he had set
himself much to do, he sought his father.
Sealing his lips thenceforward against the
mystery which had hurried his action, he
spoke out, and told him he had married
Eleanor Thurlocke, and that he hoped
he might be forgiven if he had seemed
undutiful; and before the old Earl, who
was dressing, could show his rage, quietly
walked away, and rode over to Frambleworth,
and made almost the same speech,
in Eleanor's behalf, to the squire. Such
wrath, and curiosity, and excitement, and
upbraiding were never in this neighborhood
before; for the two young people<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
lived in the eyes of many who wished
them well, and who looked for a great
wedding, with masques, and dancing, and
holiday arches, and public largesses of
drink and money, such as had not been
in mid-England for a generation. Wonderful
as it seemed, the turmoil soon
passed; and the two, never stirring from
the very heart of the disturbance and
opposition, somehow lived on, and were
not parted, and slowly established a peace
with their angry kindred. Malice itself
could not hold out long against the Lord
Richard's winning ways; and ever, as he
grew older, he became sadder and gentler,
and more to be honored by all men. But
the Lady Eleanor lost the merry laughter
she once had, and shrank, in great mistrust,
even from her own family, so that
it was plain at times that her reason was
shaken. None on earth, meanwhile, save
the lovers themselves, held the clew to
their blighted lives. He never left her;
he never travelled, nor went to court, as
became his station, but sat patiently
awaiting, at home, the crowning distress
which he now knew must come upon
them. Gossip broke out again, ere long,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
as much as it dared, in the village taverns;
and there was a lifting of willing
eyebrows among the gentry dwelling near,
when, in the autumn, the incarnate disaster,
the child in the Vandyck picture,
was born. They rang the joy-bells from
the church-tower, and the tenantry came
under the eaves and cheered until faithful
old Stephen threatened them with his
blunderbuss, and drove them away. The
Earl was sitting at his cards, with his bad
foot on a stool before him, when the Lord
Richard came in, with a silken parcel in
his arms, followed only by a couple of
his sniffing hounds. 'Well, what hast
thou there, Dick?' cried the big blustering
man, not unkindly. 'Father,' said
the young stricken Lord Richard, in his
impassioned fidelity, holding the parcel
forth, 'I have my son.' And thereupon
such a mortal paleness came upon
him, and his knees shook so under him,
for the deceit, that he scarce could stand.
Seeing him quake, the old Earl, a rough
jolly creature in his better moods, laughed
long and loud.</p>

<p>"And so it seemed to the only ones
who sat tongue-tied amid the great rejoicing,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
as if the divine wrath had indeed spent
itself upon their house; the doom of the
iniquity of the forefathers, as the Lord
Richard would say to himself. What
fresh and mistaken thinking there was to
do, the miserable lad, being sane, did for
both, believing that a curse was upon
them, and that they must endure it, and
accept the torture of that alien child's
presence for some purpose hidden from
human eyes. Their pact and horrible
habit of silence weighed upon their hearts;
and had not one constrained the other,
she was very fain at times to confess, and
go, if needs be, into disgrace for the lie.
They would wander sometimes on the
terrace, hand-in-hand, without speech,
looking like brother and sister under a
common ban. It seems impossible to
understand this deliberate choice of a
wrong attitude towards life, except in the
light of that mysticism,</p>

<blockquote>
<p>'With shuddering, meek, submitted thought,'</p>
</blockquote>

<p>which ruled the Lord Richard's nature.
Meanwhile the infant changed to a noisy,
bounding rogue with black eyes, whom
his young mother hated. They called him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
Ralph, a name not borne before by any
of the Langham race. From his cradle,
the poor waif clung to the Lord Richard,
as to his only friend; and that saintly
soul, as one might take sweetly a bitter
penance, reared him in right ways, and
encouraged or chided him at need, and
won from him an awe and gratitude affecting
to see. But the Lady Eleanor would
never have him so much as touch her
gown, which the maids about the manor
laid to her troubled wits, and felt sorry
for, without more ado. The old Earl,
who liked the boy's health and pluck,
had the portrait painted for the gallery;
and even there you will notice that Ralph
is far away from her, and at her husband's
feet. Years of dereliction, therefore, these
were to the Lord Richard, having no
child of his own, and watching his intruding
heir gaining daily some virtue and
seemly knowledge, and coming, either by
nature or by his careful breeding, fully to
deserve those things to which he had no
right before God and the king. And the
boy grew, and was worthy to be loved, so
brave he was, and so truth-speaking, and
so tractable, despite his fits of temper.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
When he had passed his tenth birthday,
he was sent to Meldom School; and his
first absence lifted, as it were, the black
load from his mother's spirit; and the beginning
of her recovery, after all that she
had endured, was from that day. There
came soon to her and the Lord Richard
an unexpected happiness; for the year
1636 saw the birth of their own little
Vivian. You may believe that his father,
perplexed by the fresh aspect of the problem
before him, tried to solve it by
prayer and patience; the good heart,
chastened ever with much sorrow, and
melted away with thinking, thinking.
His wife, free of his morbid scruples,
cried out at last irresistibly for the vindication
of her little one. But the Lord
Richard was visited by a prophetic dream,
and was wrung with misgivings, less like
a man's than a woman's, in searching to
divine his duty. For he foresaw, of a
surety, in his sleep, what a poor vicious
thing his son was to be. All the estates,
being entailed, were to pass to the acknowledged
eldest, passing, therefore, by
unjust consent, in this case, to an interloper,
to the detriment of the true inheritor;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
and to maintain Ralph's right
would be a legal crime. On the other
hand, the great power and responsibility
of which he promised to make such fair
use,&mdash;what if these should become, in the
hands of that other to whom they would
be intrusted, engines for havoc in the
world, since then to disown Ralph were
a moral crime? Lord Richard wrestled
hard with his demon of doubt, to no
avail. In good time, alas, as it was ordained,
when Vivian was a bonny babe
in his third summer, the unforeseen deliverance
came. Ralph Langham was
thrown from his pony at Long Meldom
Cross, and brought home for dead. He
never spoke a word, but passed to eternity
with his fingers clasped tight on the
Lord Richard's compassionate hand, and
a great tear rolling down his round brown
cheek. His short career had been like a
cheerful cloud swimming in the sun, and
itself casting damp and darkness on the
hills below. The strangest thing of all
was the ungoverned joy which came, at
the news, upon the Lady Eleanor, a joy
dreadful, at that time, to those about;
but when it faded away, all the evil else<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
linked with it seemed to fade too, and
very shortly she was wholly restored, and
became her own comely, gracious self
again, even as she was when first the
beardless Lord Richard had told her his
love. So that the liberty of those hunted
young spirits was established in the
grave of him whom heraldry yet names
as their first-born. They laid him yonder,
in Lovers' Saint Ruth's. Where else
but there? as if in unuttered thanksgiving
that mercy had reached them at last upon
its fatal threshold. There is the tower,
Holden, and the broken top mullion (is it
not graceful?) of the great west window."</p>

<p>We swung into the prettiest open space
imaginable, close to a glassy lake, and
found the fourteenth-century church, with
its yews and leaning stones, before us.
I went silently in at Nasmith's heels.
The flooring was the perfect plush of
English grass; the roof of the nave was
living boughs. For a single huge ash-tree
had rooted itself there generations
ago, and grown much larger round than
our four arms could span, and lifted
its spread of leaves nearer heaven than
the level of the walls. Ivy hung on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
the chancel arch, and many bright-colored
wildflowers, whose seeds had
lodged in the crevices and in the blank
windows, filled the whole enclosure, bay
after bay, with a riot of color and fragrance.
Soft green daylight everywhere
caressed the eye. The chancel roof, of
exquisitely groined limestone, was still
unfallen, though it had a rift or two; and
on either side, where the monks' stalls
must have stood a dozen deep, there
were crumbling tombs, with effigies in
alabaster. I went directly up one step to a
plain small brass over against the piscina,
and pushed the weeds aside. Nasmith
knew I should not be able to decipher the
inscription, on which the rain of three
hundred summers had been sifted in.
Leaning his head against one of the piers,
a good distance down, he looked over at
me, and began to recite, in an agreeable
monotone: "'Here lieth Ralph, thirteen
years old, heir while he lived to Orrinleigh
and Gaynes; whom do thou, O
Lord! receive among the innocent.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
For Time still tries<br />
The truth from lies,<br />
And God makes open what the world doth blind.</p>
</blockquote>


<p><span class="smcap">A. D.</span> 1639.'<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span> Do you recognize the
verse? Robert Greene's. The choice
of it was so significant it must have been
the Lord Richard's doing. You will
notice that the epitaph is sensitively
worded; it is pure fact, and nothing else;
and it has, too, an affectionate sound
which has always been a sort of satisfaction
to me." "How immensely dramatic
the upshot might have been if he
had lived!" I said. "The poor little
fellow, <i>infelix natu, felicior morte</i>." I was
astonished to find a slight mist over my
eyes. "Tell me of these others next
him, Nasmith: a knight and his lady
side by side, recumbent, and therefore
pre-Reformation." Nasmith's slow, radiant,
indulgent smile was upon me, as he
moved forward from the light to where I
stood. "No," he said. "Look at the
armor and the fashion of the dress, not
at the attitude, which is unusual, of
course, for the Caroline period. Those
are the blessed twain of whom I have
been telling you. See!" He pointed
to the discolored raised Latin text which
ran around the wide slabs beneath. I
traced it out. "Pray for the souls of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
Richard Esme Vivian Langham, Viscount
Gaynes, and of Eleanor his adored
wife, neither of them ripe in years, who
together, in this venerable sanctuary,
suffered calamity, and sought repose in
Christ." There were no dates. I waited
for Nasmith to go on. He did so, in
that tone of grave personal interest which
he reserves for these "old, unhappy, far-off
things."</p>

<p>"They had to lead very private lives,
on account of their proscribed creed;
a constraint which to them was not
unwelcome. Their good works, however,
were known over the whole countryside,
which is loyal to their memory.
She was the first to die, in 1640, contracting
a fever, and fading gradually
away. There were two young children
to remember her and take pattern after
her, (would that they had done so!)
Vivian and Joan. When the civil wars
began, the old Earl was feeble and near
his end; and the Lord Richard, whose
principles and natural sympathies were
all for King Charles, joined the unanimous
Catholic gentry, and sought with
eagerness the only use that seemed left<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
to him. His bright beloved presence
graced the camp but a little while, for in
his thirty-seventh year he was killed at
the second battle of Newbury, while carrying
the royal standard. They brought
him back to the old chapel where he
wished to be buried, and where none of
his house have been buried since. Both
these figures were made under his own
eye, when his wife's dust was laid below.
Are they not nobly and delicately wrought,
and full of rest? His hand holds hers;
he had always said they should lie so,
as his namesake king and Anne of
Bohemia, long ago, lay in the Abbey at
Westminster. The ruin has taken its
traditional distinctive name of Lovers'
Saint Ruth's from them. All my parish
maids steal in on Hallowe'en to kiss these
joined hands, and wish themselves good
fortune, and hundreds of &mdash;&mdash;shire sweethearts
have plighted their troth here,
under the stars. It has always been a
place of pilgrimage, though its full
history is not even guessed at. Saint
Ruth's-on-the-Hill, my friend, can never
buy or borrow such a charm as this."</p>

<p>As he paused, we heard the plaintive<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
interruptive note of a pair of wood-doves
in the ash. He looked at me again. "I
forgot to say that they were content to
die, my martyr hero and heroine of Orrinleigh,
for they had won four years, at the
end, of absolute unbroken bliss. They
used to come down here every evening for
a talk, or a hymn to Our Lady, arm in
arm, and happy as children all the way.
Their day of storms was brief, and it had
a lovely sunset." "Ah, Nasmith," I
exclaimed, like a sentimental girl, "I
am glad of that. How did you know?"
He drew his foot idly through the soft
sward as he spoke. "I had the whole
story in the Lord Richard's own hand.
He wrote it out during the last night he
spent at the manor, with his spurs and
sword lying by him ready for the morrow:
the whole tender, tragic story, with
his curious mental struggles laid bare.
He thought the truth due to his father,
and to his dead stainless Eleanor, to clear
her memory from erring rumor which
had early got abroad. The manuscript
was put away under a seal; and as soon as
his son's will was opened, the Earl knew
where to find it; I have seen it all scorched<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
and stained with the old man's tears.
No eye, from his to mine, has read it
since. You see, the next and fourth Earl,
Vivian, grew up a graceless cynic reprobate
in London, never visited his estates,
and cared nothing for his lineage. His
sister was little better. I ought to spare
her and her second husband any vituperations,
since they did me the courtesy of
becoming my great-great-great-great-grandparents!
Did I never tell you? The
Langhams, bad enough in the beginning,
have been a worse crew than before, since
the Lord Richard's time. Almost 'every
inch that is not fool is rogue,' as Dryden
says of his giant. Francis, the ninth of
the line, lately dead, and his Countess,
being my very distant relatives, and impressed
with my virtues, which were then
being wasted on the desert air, offered me
the benefice. The first thing I did, after
setting Saint Ruth's in order, was to look
about for materials for a history of the
parish from a period before the Conquest.
During the summer, they put a world of
papers, grants, charters, registries, and
so on, into my way, which had been
heaped in some old chests in the tool-house.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
One of these papers was that
letter, a pearl in sea-kelp. I took it
promptly over to Orrinleigh. The Earl
was in his hunting-coat, swearing, over
his glasses, at some excellent Liberal
news in his morning journal. 'Read
this,' I said; 'it is one of your ancestral
romances, and ought to be reverently preserved.'
He laid it by. A few days
afterwards, while I was gathering fruit
and vines for a Harvest Sunday, he
pulled it from his pocket, and threw it
at me over the garden wall, remarking
that as my reverend appetite was for
musty parchments, he did not know but
what I had best have this one, especially
as his wife and niece, having glanced at
it, would not give it house-room! So I
had the keepership of that mournful
secret of the Lord Richard's wonderful
love and patience, which came near altering
the local annals I was to write. It
was like the unburied dead; it tormented
me. Not one of those vulgarians to
whom it really belonged was fit to touch
it, much less understand it; and I did
not wish to add it to any collection, mine
or another's. I hesitated a good bit, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
then I stole off, on a chilly Martinmas
eve, and piously burned it here in Lovers'
Saint Ruth's, on this tomb, and scattered
the ashes into the grass." A gust of
wind came into the choir, and the clock
half a mile away struck one. At the
sound, we reached for our hats, which we
had instinctively laid aside, and crossed
the little transept to the door, Nasmith
first, I following, as we had entered.
Once more, as we left the porch, dark
with ivy and weather-stains, we heard the
wood-doves, over our heads in the nave,
utter a slow musical moan, one to the
other. "Their souls," I whispered suddenly.
"Peace to all such, after pain,"
said poetic Cyril. "<i>Amen</i>," I answered.
We both smiled. How we two were
enjoying our renewed society, back in a
bygone England!</p>

<p>Hardly had we gained the road, when
a carriage rolled by, with a single figure
on horseback clattering alongside. A
black-bonneted girl in mourning, handsome,
if furtive, under her parasol, and
both her companions, the younger of
whom sat beside her, saluted Nasmith in
what I thought to be a cold, perfunctory<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
manner. I guessed something, for his
honest cheek flushed. "I fear these are
the great folk of Orrinleigh," I remarked.
"The men have selfish, stupid faces,
more's the pity." "Yes," he replied; "you
have seen some of the Lord Richard's
degenerate descendants. I once meant to
give his manuscript to Audrey&mdash;to the
young lady in the carriage. I hoped she
might value it. But, as I said, I destroyed
it instead. You are the only person
to whom I ever repeated the tale, and
almost in the original words. Go put it
in a book, if you like, Holden; make
what you can of it; develop and proportion
it; I trust your handling." I
thanked him. "No. Your chivalrous
Cavalier is too complex a subject for
me," was my frank reply; "I feel safer
with a history than with a mystery." I
was a hardened republican novelist even
then, and his senior, and not blind to the
"human document," neither of the seventeenth
century, nor of the nineteenth.
"Nasmith," I began cunningly, "you
were in love with the Honorable Audrey,
and she refused you. How fortunate for
you! Yours was the neatest and most<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
spiritual revenge I ever heard of: to keep
from her what might have helped transform
her woman's nature, stifled in an ill
atmosphere,&mdash;the knowledge that she was
of the blood of the saints,</p>

<blockquote>
<p><span class="indent2">'Tho' fallen on evil days,</span><br />
On evil days tho' fallen, and evil tongues.'"</p>
</blockquote>

<p>He gave my hand a half-humorous pressure,
his head turning neither to right nor
to left, dear old Nasmith! He must be
past forty now, and they tell me, moreover,
that he is a Benedictine monk at
Downside: he will care nothing what I
say of him. And thus we climbed the
balmy downs, back to our lunch at the
vicarage, without another word.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">OUR LADY OF THE UNION.</h2></div>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> Surgeon and the Chaplain had
been bidden to roast beef and mashed
potatoes in the great tent; and the former,
leaving its pleasant firelight, had come
out through the night air a little before
taps, to spread himself and his triumphs
in the eyes of the officers' mess. The
Surgeon was a widower in his early prime,
and tenderly condescending to the known
ways of women. He talked much of the
two who in that camp represented all inscrutable
womankind, Miss Cecily Carter
and Mrs. Willoughby. They had
come from New York on a visit, Braleton
being just then in profound quiet.
The Surgeon adored Miss Cecily, in
which mood he was by no means alone;
but he had his own opinion of her sister,
the Colonel's wife. "The Sultan has
hinges in him, and can unbend," he
would say; "but the Sultana&mdash;O Jerusalem,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
my Happy Home!" He had
also discovered that the train of trunks
at the sutler's, objects of deep and incessant
objurgation, were hall-marked "A.
W.," and that Miss Cecily came to the
war with one hand-bag. His auditors sat
long astride their chairs, each in his hood
of good government tobacco-smoke. The
Adjutant's silver-coated hound was asleep
on the boards, still as a little mountain-tarn
among thunder-clouds. The gusts
of genial mirth were suddenly interrupted
from without by the even voice of the
orderly: "Sergeant Blanchard is wanted at
the Colonel's quarters."</p>

<p>A young man playing chess in the
corner arose at once, and followed. All
along the company streets, the lamp-light
streamed through the chinks in the tents;
charming tenors and basses, at the far
end, were laying them down and deeing
for Annie Laurie; and from the long sheds
nigh, in the grove, came the subdued
pawing and tossing of the horses. Robert
Blanchard saluted, and stood outside in
the dark, for the Colonel was in his doorway.
"They have sent another commission
for you," he said shortly. "You<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
deserve it; your behavior has been admirable,
a source of immense pride to me,
and to all my men." The Sergeant looked
at him with a visible gladness. "I thank
you. You know I prefer not to be promoted."
"I have humored you no fewer
than three times before," resumed the
Colonel, in an altered tone; "I can't do
it always. You are known; the General
has complimented you. The rise of a
man of your stamp can't be prevented,
even by himself. You are meant, if you
live, to move rapidly, and go high. This
second-lieutenantship is the lowest step;
mount it, in Heaven's name, and don't
maunder."</p>

<p>The other hesitated, silent. Then he
said: "May I have my condition, if I
accept,&mdash;may I remain color-bearer?" "I
can promise nothing of the kind. I fear
it would be unusual, to say the least; it
has no precedent in any service that I
ever heard of. Don't ask me that again."
Blanchard, in sober fashion, brought
his hand to his cap. "Good-evening,
Colonel." The superior officer was exasperated.
"Bob," he exclaimed discursively,
"you're a fool. God bless you!"</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>The drums began, quick and light; it
was nine o'clock. The Sergeant went
back, cheerful as Cincinnatus refusing
empery. Before he confided himself to
his blanket, lumped on boughs, he made
sure that a fold of old bunting on a
provisionary stick was slanted securely
against the canvas; for he had a sentimental
passion for the flag. When it
was hauled down at sunset, it went into
his hands until daybreak. He had borne
it in the van since his first bloody day at
Little Bethel; it had been riddled, stained,
smoke-blackened, snapped from its support;
but he had never dropped it, not
when a minie-ball fizzed through his
shoulder, not when, fresh from the hospital,
he had fallen face downward from
his dying horse, in Beauregard's plunging
fire of shell. In this lad of twenty-two
there burned a formal loyalty so
intense, so rooted in every fibre of his
grave character, that his comrades, for
whom military routine had lost much of
its glamour, loved him for it, envied him,
and consistently nagged the life out of
him with the nickname of Our Colored
Brother, and other nicknames based on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
other puns more or less felicitous. Because
in New York, they had several dear
friends in common, the Colonel, on the
morning of the ladies' arrival at Braleton,
had asked him to lunch with them.
"My Sergeant, Adela," so James Willoughby,
in his eagles, presented him to
the wife of his bosom, "my Sergeant;
and such a Sergeant!" For he read in
her tacticianary social eye that a Sergeant
was a minnow indeed for a Colonel's
friend and guest, even if he were a gentleman,
a cousin of the Windhursts, and
the hero of his corps. And she wondered
at him the more that he should be
a mere color-bearer; a spirited able-bodied
creature two years in the army, with
nothing to show for it! He had no explanation
to give her, but he had an unaccountable
hunger, from the first, to
confide his secret to Cecily. He had
seen her from a distance, and his heart
stood still there in the grass; when he
came nearer, it gave him, for a certain
reason, the veriest wrench in all his life,
such as True Thomas may have felt
when the sweet yet awful call came to
him at last in the market-place, that it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
was time to say good-bye to earth, and
go back to fairyland; to leave for the
things which can never be the things
that are. He often found her sewing
on a silken tri-color, and working its
correct number of stars in a pattern.
She had begun it in her father's house,
for her brother-in-law's regiment, and
none too soon, for the flag in use was
aging fast. Robert Blanchard never saw
her head bent over that bright glory, filling
her lap and falling around her feet,
without a tightening of the throat. And
when she nodded to him going by, with
that candid, affectionate grace which never
changed, it reminded him inevitably of
something which made him happy and
unhappy. He could not remember, he
said to himself, when he had not loved
her, and yet they had never met until this
Virginian winter of 1863.</p>

<p>Cecily had taken up her abode in a wee
log-house built for her as an ell from the
Colonel's tent, delighting much in its frugalities
and small hardships. She was becoming
attached to the sights and sounds
of camp-life: the tags and tassels, the
shining accoutrements, and the endless<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
scouring and brushing thereof; the rosy
drummer-boy; the company drills in the
rain; the hollow pyramids of the stacked
short bayonets; the muddy wells on the
bluish and reddish lowlands; the loud sing-song
of the little bearded Corporal interruptedly
reading <i>David Copperfield</i> to a
ring of enraptured privates; the welcome
drone of the cook announcing his menu;
the arrival of despatches, with the thundering
and jingling of the cavalry heard a mile
away; even the occasional alarms. The
long inactions under McClellan, hateful
to her mettlesome brother-in-law and
to his men, proved pleasant enough to
Cecily; she never lacked entertainment.
While Adela was at her accurate toilets,
and the Colonel, a severe disciplinarian,
busy with his troops, she, active and
curiously adventurous, walked or rode
about alone.</p>

<p>The nine-hundred-acred Brale house
topped the hill not far away; the owner,
a fine old planter, lived there with the
survivors of his family. Six months
before, an infantry regiment had bivouacked
on the place. A lieutenant,
sent on the reasonable suspicion that a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
number of escaped Confederates were harbored
on the premises, clattered up, with
an escort, to demand them. The eldest
son, with true sullen Confederate pluck,
refused him admission. After no long
parley, the infantry lieutenant, losing control
of himself, shot him dead: a proceeding,
which, when it came to the ears
of the authorities, cost the bully his commission.
The two other sons, Julian and
Stephen, were then in the Southern army;
the younger had since perished from fever.
To this doomed and outraged household,
shut in from the world, hopelessly embittered
against the Government in whose
name murder and devastation stalked,
Colonel Willoughby appeared as a new
and strange being. He made it his business
to see that there were no trespassings,
and that the Brales lived not only
in peace, but in comfort. He rode out
repeatedly to the picket-lines, where a
goodly quantity of commissary supplies,
spirits, flour, tobacco, tea, and coffee, and
divers other necessaries difficult to obtain,
were handed over to the slaves in
exchange for the chickens, milk, and eggs.
On several occasions, he had ridden as far<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
as the door, once to give the married
daughter her pass through the lines; once
to bring her little girl, who was ill, some
delicacies sent in a hamper from his own
home. These things broke the proud
Brale hearts. They barely thanked him;
his Federal uniform was like a dagger in
their eyes. But a while ago, when they
heard that his wife and his sister were
coming to Braleton from the north, the
stately old squire had sent him a royal
gift, with a short letter in the style of the
last century. The gift was Molly, the
beautiful black, famous all over the country
for her strength and speed; and on
her back was a saddle of magnificent
workmanship, with a movable pommel,
which might be adjusted to suit the ladies.
While these were in camp, therefore, the
Colonel rode Messenger, his stocky sorrel,
and Adela or Cecily sat majestically
enthroned upon the majestic Molly. The
former was a horsewoman of experience,
erect, neat, orthodox, approved of connoisseurs
everywhere. But the regiment
was in this, as in other things, all for the
favorite; and when she came in sight,
(with the dare-devil mare going it, six leaps<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
to a mile,) lying flat forward, like her own
cavalrymen, with breathless, laughing face,
and hair shaken loose along Molly's mane
like the sun on a torrent,&mdash;such a cheer
as would go up from the distracted Eleventh!
Cecily and Molly, in the tingling
pine-odorous Braleton air, made a familiar
and joyful spectacle.</p>

<p>South from the mansion lay an Episcopal
chapel, now dismantled, with a squat,
broad, mossy roof pulled down over its
eaves like a garden-hat; and around it
spread the small old churchyard, with its
stones neck-deep in freshening grass and
clover. From this point there was a most
lovely view over the melancholy landscape,
silvered midway with a winding
stream. Hither Cecily loved to climb,
tying Molly in the copse below, to lie
upon the shaded escutcheoned tomb of
one Reginald Brale, "borne in Salop in
olde Ingland," and to muse long and
happily, forgetful of battles, on</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"The great good limpid world, so still, so still!"</p>
</blockquote>

<p>She and Robert Blanchard had had
much constant companionship; it was
natural that these musings should turn<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
much, and indeed more and more, upon
him. Surely, he was like no one else;
and his presence gave Cecily a sense of
infinite rest. She, too, had her obedient
energies and controlled fervors. A great
crisis like this, holding great issues,
brought the two so sensitive to it very
near together. She felt under her, even
as he did, the tide-wave of patriotic emotion,
sweeping the more generous spirits
from all our cities out upon its fatal
crest. She had seen the companies marching
to the front through awe-stricken
crowds, watched for the bulletins, worked
for the hospitals, heard the triumphal
never-to-be-forgotten eloquence and music
sacred to the returning dead at home, and
felt to the full the heartache and enthusiasm
of all the early war. These things
had formed her, pervaded her, projected
her out of herself, and brought her,
lingeringly a child, into thought and
womanhood. Before she knew herself
for an abolitionist, the day of Sumter
swept over her like a flood, and diverted
all the little idle streams of her being.
Her brothers found her against the old
tree in the garden, the newspaper in her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
hand, like one entranced; and one of
them, soon to devote his youth to the
cause of Michael against Lucifer, forbade
her being teased to account for her
mood. Unlike Robert, Cecily came of a
soldier race, and from swords drawn, each
in its generation, at Naseby, at Brandywine,
at Monterey. That fortune seemed
good to her which had led her to Virginia,
a ground balancing in the scales
of fate, and rich already with hallowed
graves. To the living men about her,
she was as march-music never out of their
ears, to hold them to their vows. Subdued
from common cares, Cecily was in
the current of the national peril, inspiring
and inspired, and open to every
warmth and chill of it as if it were indeed
her own.</p>

<p>She was on the hills, reading, in
balmy February weather, when she became
aware of a low whinny at her ear.
The Brale paddocks were on the other
side of the fence. A young colt was
there, startled and timid, stretching towards
her; then another came as near,
and another, and the heads of the older
horses, confiding, appealing, crowded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
over these. She patted their tremulous
nostrils, divining instantly that something
had occurred to alarm them. She raised
herself from Reginald Brale's venerable
slab, and listened; the sharp ping! ping!
of blank cartridges struck the oak-leaves
on her left. Standing, and peering down
the steeper side of the incline, she saw
the familiar moving glitter of gold braid,
far below; and, stripping a bough, and
knotting her handkerchief, she made a
signal of distress, and waved it vigorously.
The shout that followed told her
that danger was over, both for the gentle
intelligent creatures in the enclosure, and
for her; the reports ceased. A moment
after, a man sprang over the churchyard
wall from the road. It was the Sergeant,
more excited than he dared show.</p>

<p>"Miss Carter!" His heart-thuds made
it hard for him to be punctilious. "Are
you hurt? Idiots that we were to choose
this place! We might have known. Tell
me you're not hurt, Miss Carter." "I
am not hurt at all," she answered gayly,
"nor even frightened. It was these dear
four-legged 'rebs' who were frightened."
She slipped her book in her pocket, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
took up her gloves and the dainty whip
which Molly had never felt, save when it
flicked a fly from her ear. "You are a
brave soul!" the Sergeant said. Cecily
took refuge in the significant flippancy of
gamins: "You're another!" which was so
apposite that they both laughed. As they
descended the rough foot-path, the Sergeant
longed to offer his arm; but he knew
her stoicisms, her natural physical <i>savoir-faire</i>,
and he chivalrously refrained. How
nimble and graceful, how fawn-like she
was! He noted the wide lace collar and
the brooch at her chin; the sober Gordon
plaid gown, not too long; the firm little
wrist; the beautiful hair parted, and
looped low.</p>

<p>"What were you doing just now?"</p>

<p>"A party of us were enjoying ourselves,
shooting."</p>

<p>"Birds?" in a cold, regretful tone.</p>

<p>"Birds! No. A soldier, unless he is
spoiling with garrison idleness, won't waste
his genius for killing on innocent birds
and their like. Besides, the artillery fellows
over yonder have scared them away
from the whole neighborhood. We were
target-shooting with pistols. Oh, if you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
knew the hot coals and icicles I had to
swallow when I recognized you up there!"
He looked ahead, and saw with joy that
his companions had departed. "Here is
Molly, and my bay is behind the rock.
May I ride home with you?" He helped
her to mount, and sprang into his own
saddle. The lonely, lovely earth and sky
were theirs together; they went slowly,
slowly down to the ford. Molly was
thirsty, or else perverse; for she paused,
lowered her aristocratic little head, and
began to drink. Presently Saladin, the
bay, standing by her on the brink, did
the same; and the two riders sat, perforce,
conscious of their like silent sympathy
and society. An impulse rushed on each
to lean over towards the other also, to
lay cheek to happy cheek over the shallow
water, in their youth, in the sun.
The Sergeant stiffened himself with an
effort.</p>

<p>"Although it is a holiday," he said,
scanning the distance, "and although
there's no end of jollity afoot, greased
poles, football, leap-frog, hurdle-races,
and all that&mdash;and did you know that
Mrs. Willoughby, escorted by the Colonel<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
and the Adjutant, had gone for the day?
There are to be charming diversions at
the infantry camp, and a ball to wind
up with. You were asked, too, I hear;
but you missed it, straying off to your
hermitage."</p>

<p>"I am glad I did! Please finish your
sentence."</p>

<p>"Oh, I forgot. I was going to add
that this sort of relaxation, just now,
might be risky, when Old Glory and I
may be ordered out before morning to
waltz to fife-music!"</p>

<p>"A battle? Do you truly think it
likely?"</p>

<p>"I half believe it. I don't mind telling
you I have a premonition of it, involving
another premonition regarding
myself. But what of it? Our old friend
Cicero, I think it was, used to say that
we are born not for ourselves, but for the
Republic." He laughed, as if he had
said a jocund thing. He had not meant
then to test her feeling for him; but he
had allies in the hour and its emotion.
Cecily rejoiced in his cheerful
acceptances, and remembered her impersonal
pride in the circumstances of his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
enlistment, of which she had heard on all
sides at home. Her voice fell, unawares,
into its shy inflections, its little wild spontaneous
minors, as she said, seeing the
horses rear their heads: "Will you please
tell me, Sergeant Blanchard, how you
came to join the army? All that I know
is that you were abroad, and that you
gave up your pleasure, and came back."</p>

<p>He began quietly, as they passed the
stream and made for higher ground:</p>

<p>"It is quite a story. I was off on
a tour through India and Egypt, with
my college chum, my dear old Arthur
Hughes. Neither of us had any notion
of returning home, and we were in the
middle of the best time two fellows ever
had on this earth, when I had a queer
sort of warning. We were both curled
up on the window-sill of my room, in
our hotel at Cairo, one hot night, sleepless,
and enjoying a smoke. Suddenly,
above the street, among the shadows
and spangled points of all those near
domes and pinnacles, I saw what I
thought was our national flag, hanging,
hardly stirring. It seemed to spring up
out of nothing, in its familiar, varied<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
colors, to startle my eye. Then, in a
moment, I perceived that it was no flag,
but a living spirit, a genius, a guardian
angel, whatever you like to call it,
which bore the oddest resemblance to
one. There before me was the dreamiest
figure; a tall beautiful young woman in
a helmet, the moon shining on the little
spike of it. A long blue veil, bluer than
the atmosphere, covered her face, and was
blown about her shoulders, not so heavy
of texture but that the jewels in her
flowing hair flashed through it with wonderful
lustres; and her garment fell away
in long alternate whites and reds, like the
liquid bars we sometimes see flushing
and paling in our own sky in the north,
when the aurora borealis comes in the
March evenings. There she floated many
minutes before fading away; and once
she raised her veil and beckoned, and her
eyes dwelt on me so imploringly that they
have become more real to me than anything
else in my life. I tell you it shook
my heart.... Miss Carter, if you will
allow me, I must say that the vision was
like, was very like,"&mdash;the Sergeant
choked a little,&mdash;"like you. When I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
first saw you, I was so startled, it gave
me, well, almost a swoon. That is a
novel word, and ludicrous, perhaps, but
I can use no other. At any rate, the resemblance
has drawn me towards you, I
can't say how strongly or how much.
Please forgive me." For Cecily's wild-rose
face was warm.</p>

<p>"I had forgotten all about Arthur.
But when I turned to clutch him in my
excitement, my first glance told me that
he had not seen the phantom, and that
he would deride my faith in it. So I
tried to laugh off my sudden attack of
second-sight; but it was of no use. I
dropped into silence when it was my turn
to speak, and abandoning presently the
effort to seem indifferent, I parted from
him, and went to bed.</p>

<p>"It was the only ghostly thing that
had ever happened to me, and it impressed
me tremendously. For my part,
I could get no rest by day or night; that
influence was over me like a bad star. I
racked my brain to explain it by natural
agencies, and it only set me thinking the
more of our blessed country being in some
terrible trouble. When I came to that, I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
jumped up and started for the bath, to
cool off, and then changed my mind, and
struck first for the ticket-office. Whom
should I knock into on the way but old
Arthur in his fez, fierce as a lion. 'Bob,'
he said, dragging me into a booth, 'it's
war, war! President Lincoln is calling
for men, and I'm going home to spite
the devil.' 'There's no choice. I am
going home anyhow,' I said. 'What
news is there?'</p>

<p>"The little which had travelled that far,
I heard from him. Sumter was being
fired upon, on the 11th of April, 1861,
when I saw Our Lady of the Union. I
call her that; but I never spoke of her
to Arthur, or to any one. Before June
set in we arrived in New York, and we
volunteered. Arthur has distinguished
himself right and left. He is in Andersonville
now, dear fellow. I should hate
to end there."</p>

<p>"A martyr is a martyr; the place matters
nothing," the girl replied.</p>

<p>"I know," he said; "I did not mean
to speak lightly; but I am one of those
who cannot always avoid it when they
feel much."</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>The Sergeant's cheeks were burning
too, and he quickened his pace. Cecily
did not speak, following the bounding
bay. But a loneliness which she could
not define came upon her; a resentment
of the sacred ideal which could
yet be to her friend his divinity, his
beauty, his bride, in a world from which
she was shut out as an irrelevance. And
almost as soon, she questioned herself
whether because of a tie dearer than
the human, this golden-hearted Robert
must lose, she in him must lose&mdash;what?
For answer, the noble and foolish tears
welled up from the depths, and fell into
the folds across her knee. Her companion
drew his own rein, and laid his
hand upon Molly's.</p>

<p>"Oh, why do you cry? I can't bear
it. What have I done?"</p>

<p>"Nothing."</p>

<p>"I did not intend to disturb you, to
make you care about it, or pity me; I
am much happier since that happened.
Could it be&mdash;oh, could it be&mdash;" He
gazed a moment upon her, absorbedly
and absorbingly, and she turned away.
For who can make conscious preparation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
for the imminent? Sudden ever is the
finger of Death, to the watchers; sudden
also is Love.</p>

<p>They were under the shade of some
giant pines. The young man vaulted
lightly to the ground, close to Molly's
satin stirrupless flank, his hands clasped,
his head thrown back, fired with adoring
hope. When Cecily inclined towards
him again, he saw in her (or was it his
bewitched fancy?) the remote, incredible
radiance of his old day-dream. The great
flush rolled responsive to his own clear
brow. He shook himself free, and found
his voice. "Cecily," he said simply, "I
love you; you must know that I love
you. Such a love has no beginning and
no end. You understand that and me.
Of myself I have nothing to say. You
have seen me only among Willoughby's
recruits; but I never wished to be elsewhere.
Judge of me, as we two are, now
and here. Can you, do you think you
could be my wife, by and by? Tell
me. Tell me!" Then Cecily, simple
too, in the same tremor of exaltation,
put out her right hand. He caught at it
with both his own, and buried his face<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
there. His wide hat had fallen; the
warm light was on his clustering hair.
With a sweet instinct like motherliness,
his maid, bending over, kissed it
in benediction.</p>

<p>It was two o'clock when they crossed
the ford, and the late afternoon found
them still pacing on their roadless way,
like the lost enchanted knight and lady
of the Black Forest. They were less
than a mile from Braleton, on the rocks,
in sight of the tents, when they unsaddled
and tethered the horses, and made
the last halt. "Dearest," the Sergeant
had said, lying at her feet, his elbow in
the grass, "dedicate my sword." Raising
himself, he made a motion as if
drawing it, and held it towards her and
the sunset; Cecily, in the same pretty
pantomime, touched her lips to the viewless
blade, priestess of a new investiture.
"One thing we both love better than ourselves;
is it not so?" She was not
jealous now. "These United States,
right or wrong!"</p>

<p>"Oh, no!" The soldier sheathed his
sacred weapon. "Say justice, liberty, the
rights of man; the things our United<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
States ought to stand for." Then the
light heart in him laughed; and Concrete
and Abstract blessed each other. Happy
and silent, they lingered on the brow of
the pine copse; a breeze sprang up; vast
and gorgeous sky-colors spread and deepened.
The Sergeant's uplifted face was
fixed upon his betrothed. She seemed to
dissolve away before him, or before him,
rather, to be vivified and set free. Slowly
between her and him, transubstantiating
her touching beauty, gathered a solemn,
changeful, wavering cloud-splendor of
ivory, rose, and sapphire, gathered out
of the land of myths into recognized and
unforgotten fact. For a quarter of an
hour he endured that mystical glory;
then his head dropped forward on her
knees. A thing seen was yet upon him:
once more Our Lady of the Union, but
with a smile as if of one assured at last
of ransom, and ineffably content. When
Cecily touched him, wondering, he shuddered,
and brushed an imagined film
from his eyes. She sat there, innocent
of any magic, unaware in what potter's
hand her spirit was so much fine clay.</p>

<p>From the depths of the vale the croak<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
of frogs arose, faint here and shriller there,
then long-drawn and general: ever a
most mournful, homesick, and foreboding
sound to our armies in the South. The
distant camp seemed ominously quiet;
but on the outskirts of it was a dissolving
shadow, a moving dark clot, there,
a moment back, between them and the
scarce-fluttering flag, and still there, now
that the flag was hauled down, its bright
hues effaced against the more vivid evening
air. Presently the group of men, for
such it was, scattered. Cecily's keen sight
read what was written afar; the familiar
figure of the one-armed brisk Lieutenant-Colonel
in the saddle coming towards the
hill, with others following on the gallop
behind.</p>

<p>"You are needed," she said without
preamble; "you must go to them."
With emphasis and authority, slight and
quick, yet irrevocable, she spoke. He
turned about, and sprang to his feet from
his enchantment at her side; for the
divine day, the Sergeant's field-day, was
over. "Is this the way of women, or
only your way? You send me from you
on a supposition, a scruple," he answered,
plaintively.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>"Go." She repeated it softly, and with
closed eyes, lest she should look upon
her own heart-break. "It is unnecessary,
as you know," he replied; "but
if you make it a point of honor, I am
glad to obey." He held out his hands,
and she took them, cherishing, steadfast,
as in a pact. Her voice and step were
strangely unsteady; they held up the
mirror, as it were, to his. What was
there in a commonplace incident to move
them so to the depth? In a passionate
presentiment, he drew her closer to him.
"Are we to be given to each other only
that we may be severed, and suffer the
more? What if the end should be now?
Cecily!"</p>

<p>But the young heroic mettle rose to
meet his. "Beloved, you are mine and
not mine. You are consecrated for the
term of the war; so am I. I will always
give you up to your task. Perhaps you
may measure by that whether I love
you." He looked down with a grateful
sigh on her who so mysteriously held him
to his sacrifice, and shared it, and through
her and in her, on the old, old fate which
he knew now was driving him to the cliff.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>"If there is to be a fight, I want your
flag, the flag you made!" he whispered,
grasping at anything to hide this rending
in him of the spirit from the flesh. "However,
whenever I fall, I want to be buried
in it. Is it done? May I take it
for mine, before it is presented to the
regiment?"</p>

<p>"Yes. You shall carry my colors here
and in heaven. I will pray for my
knight."</p>

<p>He kissed her once, twice, for the betrothal,
and yet again for the farewell.</p>

<p>He took Molly, the fresher animal of
the two, and spurred to the open ground
below, breaking out from the wood-path,
ready for any duty, on time. He looked
illumined, detached, transfigured: a Saint
Michael to be remembered after by his
companions in the moral crises of their
lives. The Lieutenant-Colonel drew rein,
relieved. "I was wishing for you, of all
people," he said; "I feared you were far
away. There has been an alarm; we must
sleep under arms. The Colonel and most
of the officers have not returned. I will
go back now. Take these six with you,
and cross the railway tracks to Palmer's.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
It is a rough road, and a long journey;
but report as soon as you can." The Sergeant
started with his bayoneted cavalcade
in a dash westward. Cecily, apprehensive
of something unusual, saw the
slow-rising dust, and, ahead of it, the
erect leader, scaling the horizon, and vanishing
into the yet glowing sky. A pang
unutterable tore her; but, uttered, it
would have been none other than <i>Amen</i>.</p>

<p>Poor Saladin was tired enough, having
been out all day long; and Cecily led
him carefully to the plain. Every clapping
leaf, every crackling twig underfoot,
struck a chill into her bosom, on the over-shadowing
hill-slopes. She had played
too brave a part under her mental turmoil,
and in the presence of her lover,
himself too easily enamoured of death. A
spell greater than any he had felt was over
her, breathing a blackness between her
and the light. Now her ample courage
was fast giving out. She saw a face in
the thicket, and was barely able to nerve
herself not to scream. A man, in a
military dress she did not know, came
forward, and raised his cap. It was
Major Julian Brale, free at last to do<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
some scouting over his ancestral acres,
alone, and with hot revenges in his heart.
He was sorry for her, and angry at her
discovery. He apologized briefly, and
helped her to mount, not without concern,
but with a scornful coldness of manner
which he could not help. When she
had gone, he returned to the bushes,
cursing the Eleventh; for he had recognized
the saddle on the bay. The two
forces were on the brink of battle; but he
was not an expert sharp-shooter for nothing,
and if he could but get sight of that
thief, that coward, that hell-born villain
who had taken his old father's precious
Molly from him&mdash; A moonbeam straggled
in where he bent over, priming his
rifle, and he moved from it into the dark.</p>

<p>Dinnerless, supperless, much too overwrought
to go to bed, Cecily Carter sat
in the Colonel's empty tent. For company,
she had shaken out her great silken
banner over the lounge, where the firelight,
falling on it, seemed to praise its
divine destroying loveliness with a poet's
Pentecostal tongue. Once she murmured
prayerfully: "Dear Robert, dear Robert."
Something not herself had bade him go,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
and he was gone; there was all of herself
now in these fears. The little parting
from him which she was enduring became
magnified and abiding, so that she looked
upon him slain, and thought with a sort
of joyous satisfaction how under the buttons
of his old blue jacket, where nobody,
not even his mother, knew of them, were
rose-leaves all about the open wound next
his heart; rose-leaves pressed most fervently,
one by one, to her lips, and laid
there. Other caress she could not give
him; though she was his, he was the Republic's,
for ever and ever. Again, she
saw him carried on a howitzer to a green
lonely place. A stone reared itself before
her, and she read upon it an odd
inscription: <i>If ye seek the summit of true
honor, hasten with all speed into that heavenly
country.</i> She started up. Was her
brain indeed giving way? Who had
spoken? Where had she heard those
words? How piercing a beauty they
had! Were they in the Church ritual?
What did they mean? Why should
they hound her from her rest?</p>

<p>The Colonel's little ormolu clock struck
eleven. Almost on the stroke, the delayed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
revellers entered. Adela could not
fail to notice her sister's nervousness, but
attributed it to anxiety for herself. The
Sultana of the Surgeon's christening had
been prodigally feasted and flattered;
she had come home with an armful of
hothouse flowers, effulgent with gratification,
and in a talking mood. The
Colonel's boy brought in the lamps.
When the Colonel himself followed,
grown grim with the sudden tension and
commotion about, his remark was to the
point. "I'm afraid you women will have
to get out of camp, quick. I smell powder.
It is likely to be damned disagreeable."
His handsome, worldly wife, coming, butterfly-like,
in yellow, out of her dark
wrappings, fixed him with her censorious
eye. "James Willoughby! You have
been drinking." He was wont, on such
occasions, to cast a comical appealing
glance at Cecily, of whom he was fond.
She did not smile in return, and her pallor
touched him; so that he went over to
her at once. "What's the matter, child?"
he asked, with affectionate anxiety. But
an approaching clang and clatter, and the
challenge of the sentry without, took<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
from him what he meant to say; he left
Cecily to her sister, and hurried into the
air. His going added to her trouble; and
yet she would have had no solace in keeping
a friend near. Oh, the stress and
strain of dull daily incident upon that inner
universe, frangible as a bubble, where
she and Robert had begun to live!&mdash;she
and Robert, and the Love of Country
alone, for between this and them must be
union everlasting. Oh, the tyranny of all
that is, laid upon him, faithful in his place;
upon her, faithful in hers; the speechless
dealings of lonely lovers with the Lone!</p>

<p>Private Cobbe, being foremost, saluted
breathlessly: "Colonel, the pickets are
being driven in; the enemy is advancing."
The gallant fellow pressed his
hand to his thigh; he was wounded, and
he was soldier enough to feel that wound
an ignominy which had been received
obscurely, and elsewhere than on the field.
Immediately, all along the tents, arose
the multitudinous yet unconfused cries of
"Form!" and "Fall in!" from the
captains; the flapping guidons were borne
hither and thither to their places, and the
thousand horses, wheeling on their dancing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
hoofs by the gleam of lantern and
torch under the watery moon, began to
make huge, fantastic shadows along the
old parade-ground. The Colonel, drawing
on his gauntlets, and still afoot, noticed
for the first time that Cobbe and McGrath
held between them, each with an arm
around him, an officer. For an instant,
in the imperfect light, he thought him
some prisoner, until he recognized, in a
flash, Molly with her great liquid, excited
eyes, Molly with her even mane hanging
wet and limp, confronting him. Private
McGrath had held in until now. He
blurted: "I'm afraid he's gone, sir."
The Colonel took a step forward, as if it
were into eternity. The Surgeon, standing
by, echoed after him: "My God!"</p>

<p>They lifted their friend down together,
and carried him in, and laid him with
extreme gentleness where by chance the
new flag, a kingly winding-sheet, was
above him and under. The Surgeon
bent very low for a while over the lounge.
The many in the tent, used to calamity
less great than the loss of their best, held
their breath; the Adjutant's dog, close to
his master's legs, lifted his long gray<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
throat and crooned softly and mournfully,
as the band outside, far down the disparting
columns, broke into a loud, thrilling
strain, impatient for victory. The Sergeant
was dead, with a ball in his breast.
No one moved until Cecily groaned and
dropped.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
<h2 class="nobreak">AN EVENT ON THE RIVER.</h2></div>


<p><span class="smcap">Morning</span> lay over Portsmouth and
her great stretches of opaline sea. The
little islands, north to the Maine shore,
and east to the harbor-buoys, were ablaze
with red and yellow bushes to the water-brink;
the low-masted gunlows were
beating out like a flock of dingy gulls;
and from afar, pleasantly, musically,
sounded the bugle at the Navy Yard.
The Honorable Langdon Openshaw,
standing among ruinous warehouses and
wharves, built by the Sheafes in the hour
of their commercial glory under the second
George, looked down upon the clear
Piscataqua at full flood, breathing between
its day-long, Samson-like tugs at
the yet enduring piers. It was a lonely
spot; the wind had a way there, sometimes,
of waking momentary, half-imagined
odors, the ghosts of the cargoes
of wines and spices in the prodigal past.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
His own solitude, the washing tide, the
one towering linden yonder, the gambrel
roofs and ancient gardens, the felt neighborhood
of the dear wild little graveyard
where his forbears slept, steeped his heart
in overwhelming melancholy. He had
already passed a week at the Rockingham.
It was a strange date to choose, out of all
his free and prosperous life, for a first
visit since childhood to the fair old New
England borough where he was born. A
sort of morbid home-sickness had driven
him back now, in his distresses, to her
knee. For the Honorable Langdon
Openshaw, innocent of the astounding
crime with which he was charged, was out
on bail.</p>

<p>The accusation was the most inexplicable
of things. His chief characteristic
had been an endearing gentleness, which
brought him the popular favor he cared
nothing for. He was the captain citizen
of his town; he had held, in turn, every
office public esteem could give him; he
was president of a wealthy corporation
which controlled a bank. It was this
treasury which he was said to have rifled,
and its cashier whom he was said to have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>
murdered. No living creature was there
in all Connecticut but laughed aloud
when the report began to spread; but
time and circumstantial proof sobered
them, and increased the breed of cynics
and sceptics the country over. The
philanthropist, the good man, the Sunday-school
paragon, forsooth, once again
exposed in all his gangrened sanctity!
Two sickening circumstances, in the dark
designs of Providence, pointed at him
with deadly finger. One was, that at the
time of the robbery, there was an impending
crash in his vested finances,
since wholly and finally averted by his
foresight and skill; the other, that sometime
before, in the discharge of duty, he
had incurred the enmity of the victim.
Was it not possible, during Mr. Openshaw's
interval of anxiety, he, that is,
any other than he, might have dared retrieve
his fortune, and silence the witness
of his crime, George Wheeling, found
unexpectedly at his desk at midnight over
his accounts, and thrown down the stair
into the vaults? But there was a more
certain and horrible evidence. He had
been seen escaping; he had been recognized.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
The scuffle had roused the occupants
of houses near; and these, looking
forth by the city lamplight, saw the flying
figures, one of them, alas, inconceivably,
yet unmistakably, so help us God! the
Honorable Langdon Openshaw. Had
they not a perfect unanimous knowledge,
for many years, of his face, his unique
gait, his uncommon stature? Where
was there another such odd and definite
physical personality? As to the confederates,
well, there were reasons, no doubt,
why bravos should be hired.</p>

<p>Wearily, wearily, he parted his gaze
from the alluring eternity in the river,
and strolled a little distance to the warm
wall, and sat down in the late September
grasses against it, like the broken man he
was. He took off his hat, a characteristic
dark soft felt such as he always wore,
and the air was good upon his brow. His
thoughts reverted to old times. He had
no kindred except a sister living in Santa
Barbara with her family of daughters, and
between them there had never been any
marked natural affection. The distant
cousin of his own whom he had married,
had borne him no children, and she was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
dead: a gentle, negative soul, to whom he
confided little of what touched him most.
He had formed no intimate companionships.
No one save his mother, whom
he lost in his boyhood, and whose maiden
name he bore, had ever possessed much
influence over him. He was a man's
man, as the saying is, hitherto of any age
he chose, and rich in all resources. But
he had strong dormant affections, shamefacedly
expended on public orphanages
and hospitals, and on the Society for the
Prevention of Cruelty to Animals; and
he felt rightly that he could have been
fatherly, brotherly, even filial, with a
son. Ah, if he but had a son! Bulwarked
about with modern conveniences,
that, his one necessary, he had missed.
And here, in strange opprobrium, was
the end of his career and of his name.
"Lover and friend hast Thou put far
from me!" he breathed to himself, feeling,
for the first time since his calamity, a
profound submission of the soul.</p>

<p>He heard voices in the windless air.
He did not rise, for they were not approaching
him. He could not help distinguishing
the animated words.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>"This is as far as I ought to go. I
guess I'll say good-bye."</p>

<p>"They will miss you notta yet. Oh,
please do, please do stay! I starve if I
am absent. Come, one kissa more."</p>

<p>"No; wait till to-morrow, you great
baby. Go away now, and do your best
to be good."</p>

<p>"Alla righta; if you give to me one
little song."</p>

<p>"Truly?"</p>

<p>"Truly, Anita mia. I desire indeed,
this hour, the mandolin. But no matter:
sing. All is quiet: see! it can
begin."</p>

<p>Then the girl's thin bird-like voice
soared alone, not in any expected love-lyric
of the seaport streets, but in a
Christian folk-song of artless beauty.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>There was a pause after. Then Openshaw
sighed. He knew they were in each
other's arms, the morning heaven blessing
them; but with him it was spiritual
darkness, and bitter evenfall. A boat
passed below, the oarsmen curious; and
the young loiterers on the old wharf stood
apart.</p>

<p>"My angel, my sainta!"</p>

<p>"Hush! It is twelve already; I must
be off."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>"Ah, the time is so short! Cruel!"</p>

<p>"Dear, you are nicest when you are
good."</p>

<p>"Behold, I am."</p>

<p>At last the farewells and vacancy; and
then footsteps making towards the angle
of the wall. Mr. Openshaw's stately head,
crowned with the abundant glossy black
and gray which gave it such distinction in
a land of bald pates, arose upon the surprised
view of the new-comer. He, on
his part, with no question as to a gentleman's
supposed midday slumbers, stooped,
and offered Mr. Openshaw his hat. The
two, confronted, smiled a little; both
tall, aquiline, clean-shaven.</p>

<p>"I thank you. Perhaps you would
rather have me say, <i>molte grazie</i>. You are
an Italian, are you not?"</p>

<p>The other, wonderingly, but with native
grace, assented. "I am a Florentine."
How he said it! Where did he get that
gypsy princeliness, his clear pallor, the
nameless magic that takes the heart?</p>

<p>"You speak English fairly."</p>

<p>"I have been in youra country long."</p>

<p>"And I in yours, many years ago."
Now Openshaw was dallying, and consciously.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
What impelled him to open
sociabilities with such an one, he did not
know. This stripling of another grade
reminded him dimly of something, and
teased his eye. "What a bearing the
fellow has!" he thought again. Having
snapped every tie with his own life, he
could afford to be interested in that of
others. He took pleasure in the diverting
accent and idiom, and the abandon with
which the loose, rough clothes were worn.</p>

<p>"Florence is the most beautiful of
cities. You ought almost to go back."
It relieved his heart somehow, the foolish
commonplace, as might the colloquy
about the weather among aristocrats in
the tumbrils of the French Revolution.
All time hung a mortal weight upon his
hands; nor did the un-Americanized
stranger seem to be in a hurry. But now
he started a little.</p>

<p>"Go back? Santa Maria! I suffer:
I go back so soona that I can!" As he
spoke, with the soft round harp-like Tuscan
tone which the east wind of New England
had not rasped, he glanced around
apprehensively. "With money, nexta
month, I sail on the sea, and I arrive."</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>"Well, that might be worse," said the
elder man, indulgently. "May I ask
your name?"</p>

<p>"Ralph Power."</p>

<p>"Ralph Power? That is not an
Italian name."</p>

<p>"Sir, I know. My mother, she have
the marriage name Potenza. Rodolfo,
that is mine. I translate the two, and
that is Ralph Power, whicha make it easy
for the tongue of many."</p>

<p>Mr. Openshaw had drawn his hand
over his eyelids, as if feeling the sting of
memory.</p>

<p>"What do you do for a living here?"</p>

<p>"I serva the market. Once I assist
to builda boats for the Capitan, but now
he work no more; the beautiful Anne,
she is his daughter. Ah, signor!" Ingenuously,
boyishly, he sighed.</p>

<p>"How old are you?"</p>

<p>"Twenty-two."</p>

<p>"How many questions I have asked
you! I am afraid I have kept you from
your duties. Pray go now."</p>

<p>The other bowed, and turned townwards.
But Openshaw felt on the instant
a sort of loneliness. "Rodolfo!"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
he exclaimed, "do me the favor to
spend this." He slipped a coin into
an uninviting hand, partly, as he would
have said himself, from natural depravity,
partly, from the sheer luxury of his own
incognito, and that of giving away to a
young man what no young man could inherit.
"It may help you out of your
trouble. Trouble is very hard to bear,
sometimes."</p>

<p>If he were aware of expecting anything
in return, from a poor Italian, it was the
usual ecstatic thankful benediction of poor
Italians in like luck. Once he had lived
among them on their own soil; he knew
the simple-hearted, engaging, vagabond
breed through and through. But this specimen
of it flushed and scowled, while trying
to seem courteous; and his would-be
benefactor was puzzled. As they stood
opposite, they were of equal height; for
the younger had drawn himself up a good
inch.</p>

<p>"I am afraid you are proud. You
have picked that up in New England."</p>

<p>Rodolfo answered resentfully: "Sir, I
have the blood of New England also, and
it is for me the destiny to earn my money,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
most of all after what I promise to the
beautiful Anne."</p>

<p>As he said it, warming thus into his
very self, the eyes of Openshaw, watching
him, were dazzled, as one may be
who crosses an alcove towards a door in
plain sight, and finds that seeming door
a mirror. A little alarum-bell rang in his
brain. He shuddered, for all the forces
within him were rallying together: triumph,
hate, revenge, deadly delight;
things he had not known were possible
to him swarmed into his spirit with a
clang. He recognized, at a stroke, that
this vagrant youth, this common workman,
looking at him with no smile now,
bore a violent resemblance to himself.
He searched for details, lightning-quick,
and devouringly. Yes! there were the
dark, fine, pendulous hair, the small,
close ear, the strong nose and jaw, even
the large, slender hand toil had hardly
scarred, the back of it smooth and hard
as veined marble; how like the Openshaw
hand, plain in the old Lely portrait,
plainer yet in the Stuarts, on the melancholy
walls of his own home! And what
followed? The voice, significant, prophetic,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
of the demon of self-preservation
in his ear: "This may be the man who
killed George Wheeling. This must be
the man. Impeach him; clear yourself!"
Openshaw, in his calmer mood, a few
moments back, had measured the character
before him. Whatever else it was,
it was not astute. He foresaw no trouble
in worming the secret out of him.</p>

<p>"Very well," he replied, as if æons on
æons of thought had not passed since he
spoke last. "I will take the gold-piece
back, on your own condition: I will see
that you earn it. Have you business on
hand?"</p>

<p>"Oh, no. The venerable butcher, the
fever kills him; we bury him, and locka
the door for all day." Rodolfo was sullen
yet.</p>

<p>"Then, will you kindly go into the
square, buy me cheese, pilot bread, two
quart bottles of Sauterne, and two glasses,
and return by way of Daniels Street? I
shall be waiting at the landing. I should
like to hire a boat for an hour, and have
you row me up river. Will you do
so?"</p>

<p>The lad hesitated. Finally, touched,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
or put upon his mettle by a seeming confidence,
he set out, with the greenback in his
pocket which Mr. Openshaw had given
him. The latter, at this pause in their
colloquy, was made aware that he was suffering
keenly. He had exceeding self-control;
his successes in life had sprung
from it. But every mastered nerve in his
body, having already undergone so much,
and having so much to undergo, was humming
like a beehive. He could not stand
still. He wandered about, meeting few
pedestrians, across Water Street, up Manning
Street to Puddle Dock with its
liberty pole, and again past the graveyard,
lingering wherever he could command
a view of the broad glorious
anchorage, tragic with the exposed ribs of
rotting ships. Into the happier neighborhoods
near, he would not penetrate;
this one had been happy too, when he
was a child. There he saw but visions of
greatness gone, of comfort broken, and
an hour ago, could have laid his cheek to
the old flaggings, and wept. But he had
now a terrible just purpose, and for that
he must save his strength.</p>

<p>He was at the landing later than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
Rodolfo, who sat in a white wherry ballasted
with his purchases, the oars already
in hand. Openshaw rested his cane on
the gunwale, and stepped quietly into the
stern; they backed out of the cramped
spaces, and shot away. The surface of
the harbor was dimpling, little by little,
with the great hidden swirls of the turning
tide; deceptively glassy between its
deflected banks, it gleamed like the thin
ice which forms in November, and over
which boys send pebble after pebble, and
laugh to hear them chirruping. But
Rodolfo had learned long since how to
cajole the fierce Piscataqua; and tacking
artfully by St. John's Point, he labored
through the end arch of the great bridge,
and gained the blue highway beyond. A
train thundered overhead. Two women
in the footpath, leaning over the rail,
stared fixedly at the little boat, and from
one sensitive face to the other, and again
at their contrasted attire. They were
Rodolfo's neighbors, and pleased that he
had fallen in with a gentleman.</p>

<p>The cruisers were not back within the
hour, nor within three hours. The whole
world was to change strangely for them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
both, meanwhile. The order of what
Langdon Openshaw had intended to say
and do came to naught, because what happens
to happen is lord over the strongest
human will. He had prepared his cunning
questionings, as if to force his own
fate, forgetting that the aggregation of
outer circumstance which we call fate is
itself an irresistible vortex; the trapper,
and not the trapped. Up stream, by
Frank's Fort, under a sapphire sky, while
as yet little had been said, he found that
his watch had run down, and he asked
for the correct time. Rodolfo set him
right from a cheap timepiece. As he
handled it, there appeared, linked to the
guard, an artistic bit of bronze, a tiny
Renaissance figure, with bow and hound,
the blown draperies minutely fair. Openshaw
saw it, and the whole universe was
not so manifest to him as that small
ominous curio within it.</p>

<p>"The Diana! On your soul, where,
how, did you get that?" It was familiar
to him; he knew it, though he had not
seen it for more than a score of years.
The rower dropped it back into his breast,
definitely.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>"It is mine, and dear to me. My
mother who gave it, she is dead."</p>

<p>"Did you say your mother's name was
Potenza? Was it Agata Potenza? Agata
Boldoni once?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>There was a thronging pause.</p>

<p>"When did she die?"</p>

<p>"It was sixa years ago; I proceed to
America."</p>

<p>"Have you brothers and sisters?"</p>

<p>"I have, in Italy, twin brothers, older;
their lame-a father, Niccola Potenza, live
with them. But he is notta mine."</p>

<p>Quick, loud, sure, the queries and the
answers fell, like the hammer-strokes of
a coffin in the making.</p>

<p>"Your father was&mdash;?"</p>

<p>"How can I know? They tell me
he was vera handsome, vera rich, and
from this America. <i>Malfattore!</i> He
steal away, and I am born after; and she
see him not in her life, I see him not in
mine."</p>

<p>The crew had apparently hurt the
passenger, for the latter heaved against
the thwarts.</p>

<p>"Once more. Was your mother
ever married to your father?"</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>Rodolfo knit his brows, and set his
teeth. "No."</p>

<p>For a long, long time there was no
sound but the little singing keel on its
joyous flight, and Openshaw's head was
hidden in his hands. Rodolfo, of his own
vigorous accord, took the way of Dover
Bridge, across the noble inland bay, and
branched up the shallowing Oyster.
There by the bank, in the stiller solitudes,
he shipped his oars, and, reaching
forth, touched the bowed shoulder, not
without compassion.</p>

<p>"<i>Illustrissimo</i>, look up! Tell me."
Then did Openshaw begin, steadily, but
hardly above his breath, intent the while
on the image of his own youth before him,
as if from that only he might draw courage
to confess.</p>

<p>"I have a dear friend who, when he
was no older than you are now, went to
Italy. He spent his best years in a delusion,
for he thought then he might
become a great painter. His character,
such as it was and is, turned to the things
of good report; he was an orphan, with a
competence; but he had had no home, and
no moral training. Being something of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
a recluse, he developed late and slowly.
At a time when the storm-clouds in most
young men's lives are lifting, his were
surcharging themselves, and getting ready
to burst. On his thirtieth birthday, in
Ferrara, he&mdash;"</p>

<p>"In Ferrara, yes!" broke the eager
interruption.</p>

<p>"He persuaded another man's wife to
run away with him. She was a peasant,
very young and innocent, with a sweet
pensive Perugino face; she had been
his model, up to her marriage with Niccola
Potenza."</p>

<p>There was a sharp affirmative breath
from the listener.</p>

<p>"Niccola Potenza was a cooper, with
good prospects. He was considered
quite a match for the girl; but he turned
out to be dull, silent, and preoccupied.
Little Agata was romantic; and her
thoughts ran easily back to my friend.
The fault was, assuredly, all his. He
thought that he loved her, and so, indeed,
he did; although he loved better,
alas, the adventure and the rebellion. At
any rate, he took her away boldly from
her husband and her babes, and set up<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
life in his old studio, in Florence. The
cooper, sworn to revenge himself, had
nearly hunted my friend down, when on
Easter Day he fell from a crowded and
festooned inn-balcony, and broke his
thigh. Somehow, after that, his fury
failed him; and he sank, under his misfortune,
into a sort of apathy. Things went
wrong also with the lovers. Agata kept
only for a while her soft, joyous, docile
ways, and then grew restless and wretched,
with the canker of a good heart spoiled,
which nothing on earth can cure. She
would spend hours in the chapel near by,
her face covered, thinking and weeping;
and then she would go back to her little
household tasks, and move about in my
friend's sight, her pale penitent face driving
him wild more effectually than any
audible reproach could have done. Of
course he saw what was in her soul: the
struggle between her foolish passion for
him, and mortal home-sickness for the
inner peace which had attended her old
honorable life. He, on his part, resented
the moral awakening in her, and stamped
down both her conscience and his own.
Against the voice within which bade him,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
since he had done her an irretrievable
wrong, to take the legal burden of it
upon himself, and make her his wife in
America, arose his tyrannous social
cowardice. He dared not; he had a depraved
but intelligent dread of discord
and incongruities. And so, as many
another man as weak has done, he served
his æsthetic sense, and threw honor to
the winds. He was never, I think, wilfully
unkind to Agata; his selfishness
would seem to me now less diabolic had
he tried to estrange her from him. But
as soon as their first apprehensive year
together had passed, without any talk on
the subject, he left her. Before he took
his train, that night in May, my friend
drew up a paper for poor Agata's maintenance.
The sum was small, but much
more than she had been accustomed to
call her own. I know he had no forewarning
of&mdash;of his child; he provided
for her alone." Mr. Openshaw was speaking
with some difficulty. "When were
you born?"</p>

<p>"On the feast of San Stefano, the
twenty-sixta of December, eighteen hundred
sixta-five."</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>Rodolfo had been listening under a
strain keener than that of physical deafness.
The more nervously overwrought
of the two at this particular moment, he
was likewise the more restrained. A
certain question was hot in his throat.
Though he had not understood all of
Mr. Openshaw's melancholy monologue,
he had apprehended the heart of it only
too well. But he said nothing further.</p>

<p>A flock of pioneer blackbirds, in delirious
chatter, were gathering overhead for
their autumn migration, darkening the
narrow sky-space with their circling wings.
Openshaw looked up.</p>

<p>"Those birds go from pole to pole to
find&mdash;what? So did he. His youth was
killed in him; and before long, nevertheless,
he was cheerful and active again, and
courted by the world. He came home to
his own honest and normal life, and after
a while he married. He had no tidings
of Agata, and had actually resolved once
to try to find her, when he heard what
must have been a false report, that she
had died; and he did not doubt it, for
he used to see her faithful patient little
face in all his dreams. From what I have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
learned of late, I believe that he is most
miserable, and near his own end. He
does not deserve to hear of her last days.
But if by letting me know, you can punish
him through me, do not spare him.
I will not, I promise you."</p>

<p>Rodolfo sat in the boat, immovable,
the thin leaves of the bowery wild-grape
flapping overhead, and flickering him with
elfin light and shade. "My mother," he
began in a low voice, "did the best: the
grace of God was in her. Niccola was sick;
the trade was gone, and then was mucha
poverty. With me in her amiable arms,
she return on the feet to Ferrara, and
petition him; and, lo! the good cripple
man, he pardon. There us four in one
family, we flourish. The American money
she could notta help, go among all till all
are grown; she die of the fever sixa year
ago, with many candles and masses for
her soul; and because it is notta fit that
my brothers spend on me, I ask Niccola's
blessing, and come to America. That is
the end."</p>

<p>Openshaw inquired presently, when he
could do so: "Had you any education,
as a child? Can you read and write,
Rodolfo?"</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>"No." He sat sheepishly for a moment,
then seized his oars.</p>

<p>"How have you prospered over here?
Have you been able to save a little? You
spoke of wishing to return."</p>

<p>Rodolfo quivered. "It musta be."</p>

<p>"Why so?" There was genuine tenderness
in the two words.</p>

<p>"There is nothing of hope for me. I
am in a greata fix. I leave, I go; I cannot
stay. I have a sin also. Only my
beloved, she know how it was I transgress,
so thatta perhaps my guilt is not
for eternity."</p>

<p>Openshaw laid the tip of his stick
upon the rowlock, with authority. "Do
not start yet; let the boat drift. You
must be hungry with this long exercise.
Pray pass me those things near you, and
the wine; and while you lunch, I hope
you will be as frank with me, Rodolfo, as
I have been with you.... I look upon it
as a miracle of mercy that at the eleventh
hour we have found each other." He
knew that the young man's blazing black
eyes were full upon him. "I can help
you. Only keep nothing back." He filled
one of the glasses from the fizzing bottle,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
and passed it. But it was struck aside,
and the cry that followed was so sincere it
gave the rudeness dignity.</p>

<p>"Ah! No, no, no. Sir, I touch the
spiritual drink no more till I die. I vow
to Anita mia, after the terrible night.
For see! The evil ones, companions, take
me on a burst in a city notta this, Hartaford,
and thieve." His voice dropped
under the excitement, like a file of infantry
under fire. "They thieve a banka;
and I watch, in gin so drunk as Bacco;
and when the invisible man arise pugnacious,
I throttle him, and curse, and rolla
him down to the cellar. He moan and
expire, so that we go down to thieva
more; but the city she hears, there is a
sound, then a sound on top of him, and we
fly, fly, fly, this streeta, that streeta, till I
come back awake to this Portsmouth, and
fall on my knee to Anne, and cry tears.
Ah, my sainta! she comfort me in charity,
and talk to me, and keepa me from
the bad; and for penance I go vera dry
always, not to be damn. I tell it not to
Niccola at home when I go; and I pray
to go soon, that the Statesa Prison notta
hanga me."</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>Such is the equilibrium between the
infinite and folly, that at this juncture,
as he recalled afterwards, Mr. Openshaw
was eating his cheese. He answered,
marvelling at his own composure.</p>

<p>"I read about it in the newspapers.
You are in great danger, my poor boy.
Now listen. There is a ship sailing for
Genoa from New York next Saturday;
and on her I wish you to engage your
passage. That will give you a week to
adjust your little affairs here; and you
must, moreover, see your excellent sweetheart,
and persuade her to marry you and
go with you. Will you do that?"</p>

<p>Rodolfo opened his fine eyes very wide,
and then closed them. "Oh, voluptuous
as it would be, I cannot. The
Capitan he make Anne deny me until I
shall have many riches. She is a handmaid
of domestic service on Pleasanta
Street; but the old one, he is proud for
her, and with the mosta reason in all the
world. I shall coop with thesea my brothers
cooping always in Ferrara, and do my
parta with my soul. For bye-and-bye
we make a marriage; and then she will be
content to live in the sympathetic Italy,
where safeness is for me."</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>"But we mean to mend all that, Rodolfo.
Your father, whom I know very
well, is growing old, and has a great deal
of property with no one to share it.
The least he can do for you (I am sure
he feels that), is to put you out of the
reach of want. He will not ruin you,
nor throw you into temptations of a kind
other than those you have undergone;
for you are his son, and as such he must
love you. But he will hope to hear by
next spring, that you have bought a farm
and vineyard, and that your kind kins-people
at home, and your wife, sometimes
pray for him; yes, and for me.
Trust me; we need say no more about it.
He will have it all settled by law as soon
as he is able, but certainly within a
month." He passed his hand over his
hair, absently, and resumed. "You will
go across the ocean now; and if my friend
lives, he may come to you; but he may
not live, and he may not come. It is his
punishment not so much to lose you, or
what you might, after all, be to him, as
to recognize that his awful breach of duty
has established between you what I may
call, perhaps, in the long run, an incompatibility."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>
Poor Openshaw, on the rack
of his own candor, groaned aloud.</p>

<p>Once more they were crossing Greenland
Bay, and the lone and lovely miles
seaward. Rodolfo crept up quietly to his
strange benefactor, who was absently gazing
far away, so quietly that the wherry
moved not a muscle under him.</p>

<p>"It is you," he said. "The 'friend' is
a made-up. I know. <i>Padre, si!</i>" He
threw his arms about Mr. Openshaw, his
old hatred melted away, and lay there
on his knees like a little boy, sobbing,
sobbing. "It is for nothing at all," he
explained with his endearing semblance
of good-breeding; "but the gentle goodaness
of God. The beautiful Anne,&mdash;O
you musta see her, and letta yourself be
thank in so harmonious the voice of seventeen!
she will taka me. Behold, I am
so vera, vera happy." Quite overcome,
he did not even raise his head when he
was spoken to.</p>

<p>"Am I forgiven, Rodolfo? Can you
forgive me for your poor mother's
sake?"</p>

<p>For answer, the lad covered the hand
he held with kisses of southern fervor,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>
and pressed into it the little delicate
charm from his watch-string.</p>

<p>At the touch of it, the tyranny of yesterday
and to-morrow, and all his suffering
present and to come, departed from
Openshaw. A divine felicity began now
to possess him; he was grateful, he was
at peace; whatever his retribution was to
be, he embraced it, in spirit, like a bride.
In his revery, he seemed to stand before
the everlasting tribunal, with inscrutable
truth on his lips: "Of this that was
mine I was heedless. Because of my heedlessness,
Poverty and Ignorance and Inferiority
and Exile took him by the hand,
and led him to the pit. He is rescued
from the worst; he will cling to the highest
which he sees, with an elected soul to
help him; but what he might have been
he can never be. It was I that sowed;
let it be mine to reap. The indelible
blood that is shed is on my hands, not
on his. Visit Thy wrath upon me, for
here is it due. With body and soul,
will, sense, and understanding, from first
to last, in every fibre of my being, I
affirm me accountable for this thing."
To the tribunal on earth, its magnate of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
unblemished reputation had no explanation
to offer. He foresaw only his arraignment,
and the words with which to
clinch it: "Gentlemen of the jury, I
plead guilty."</p>

<p>Rodolfo spoke first. "I am so glad I
guess, I guess from the teara in your eye,
that time."</p>

<p>The tears welled up again as the other
replied: "There is something else you
will never guess, thank God."</p>

<p>"No?"</p>

<p>"No, my boy."</p>

<p>Rodolfo looked up, and smiled, without
irrelevant curiosity. He was too
content, afloat there.</p>

<p>The Honorable Langdon Openshaw
took charge of the tiller, the son to whom
he had twice given life still at his feet.
With neither oar nor sail the guided boat
came home from the upper waters to
the port, in the mellowing afternoon,
borne on the mighty ebb-tide of the
Piscataqua.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">THE PROVIDER.</h2></div>


<p><span class="smcap">Nora</span> cried out: "'Tis so pretty to-day!"
The barefooted children were
threading the slopes of Howth towards
Raheny. Far-off, the city, with its lights
and stretches of glorified evening water,
was lying there lovely enough between
the mountains and the sea. It was
Nora's tenth birthday, and, to please her,
they had been on the march all afternoon,
their arms full of rock-born speedwell
and primrose. "'Tis so pretty!"
echoed little Winny, with enthusiasm.
But the boy looked abroad without a
smile. "'T'd be prettier when things is
right," he answered severely. Hughey
was a man of culture; but his speech was
the soft slipshod of the south. The three
trudged on in silence, for Hughey was a
personage to his small sisters; and
Hughey in a mood was to be respected.
He, alas, had been in a mood too long.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>
He had carried Winny over the roughest
places, and shown her Ireland's Eye, and,
alongshore, the fishing-nets and trawls;
he had given his one biscuit to be shared
between them all; and lying in the velvet
sward by the Druid stone, he had
told them all he knew of the fairy-folk
in their raths, for the seventieth time.
But he was full of sad and bitter brooding
the while, thinking of his mother, his
poor mother, his precious mother, working
too hard at home, for whom there
never seemed to be any birthdays or out-of-door
pleasures.</p>

<p>Hugh was nearly twelve now, and
mature as the eldest child must always be
among the poor. He could remember
times in the county Wexford, before his
father, who was of kin to half the gentry
in the countryside, died; times when life
had a very different outlook, and when
his peasant mother, with short skirts and
her sleeves rolled up, would go gayly between
her great stone-flagged kitchen and
the well or the turkey-hen's nest under the
blackthorn hedge, singing, singing, like a
lark. They had to leave that pleasant
farm, and the thatched roof which had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>
sheltered them from their fate, and move
up to cloudier Dublin, to a stifling garret
over a beer-shop; and it was a miserable
change. Malachi O'Kinsella, the cheerful
thriftless man, with his handsome
bearing and his superfluous oratory, was
gone; and his Hughey was too young
to be of service to those he left behind.
A fine monument, with <i>Glory be to God</i> on
it, had to be put up over him in the old
churchyard, two years ago; and there
had been since the problem of schooling,
feeding, and clothing Hughey, Nora,
and Winny. Then Rose, three years old,
fell into a lime-kiln, and was associated
with the enforced luxury of a second
funeral; and Dan, the baby, born after his
father's death, was sickly, and therefore
costly too; and now the rent had to be
paid, and the morrow thought of, on just
nothing a week! All of which this
Hugh, with his acumen and quick sympathy,
had found out. He worshipped
his mother, in his shy, abstinent Irish
way; his heart was bursting for her sake,
though he but half knew it, with a sense
of the mystery and wrong-headedness of
human society.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>That April Tuesday night, when the
wildflowers were in a big earthen basin
on the table, like streaks of moonlight
and moon-shadow, and the girls were in
bed, Hughey blew out his candle, shut
up his penny <i>Gulliver</i>, and went over to
the low chair in their one room, where
his mother was crooning Dan to sleep on
her breast. It shocked him to see how
thin she was. Her age was but three-and-thirty;
but it might have been fifty.
She wore a faded black gown, of decent
aspect once in a village pew; her thick
eyelashes were burning wet. Outside
and far below, were the polluted narrow
cross-streets, full of flaring torches, and
hucksters' hand-carts, and drunken voices;
and beyond, loomed the Gothic bulk of
Saint Patrick's, not a star above it.</p>

<p>"Mother! 'tis not going to school any
more Oi'll be." His tired, unselfish
mother swallowed a great sigh, but said
nothing. "Oi'll worruk for ye, mother;
Oi'll be your man. Oi can do't."</p>

<p>There was another and a longer pause;
and then Moira O'Kinsella suddenly bent
forward and kissed her first-born. Like
all the unlettered class in Ireland, she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>
adored learning from afar, and coveted it
for her offspring. That he should give
up his hope of "talkin' Latin" touched
her to the quick. "God love ye, Hughey
darlint! Phwat can a little bhoy do?"
But she slept a happier woman for her
knight's vow.</p>

<p>As for Hughey, there was no sleep for
him. By the first white light he could
see the two pathetic pinched profiles side
by side, the woman's and the babe's,
both set in the same startling flat oval of
dark locks. The faces on the mattress
yonder were so round and ruddy! They
had not begun to think, as Hughey had;
even scant dinners and no warmth in
winter had not blighted one rose as yet
in those country cheeks. Up to yesterday,
he had somehow found his mother's
plight bearable, thanks to the natural
buoyancy of childhood, and the hope,
springing up every week, that next week
she would have a little less labor, a few
more pence. Besides, it was spring;
and in spring hearts have an irrational
way of dancing, as if a fairy fiddler had
struck up <i>Garryowen</i>. But now Hughey
was sobered and desperate.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>There was no breakfast but a crust
apiece. The McCarthy grandmother, on
the stairs, gave Nora, starting for school,
some fresh water-cresses. Just then Mrs.
O'Kinsella happened to open the door.
Poor Nora had yielded to temptation and
filled her mouth, and pretended, holding
her head down, to be much concerned
about a bruise on her knee. She could
not look in her mother's honest eyes,
ignorant as these were of any blame in
Nora. Mrs. O'Kinsella went wearily to
her charing, and seven-year-old Winny set
up housekeeping with Dan, the primroses
and a teapot-shaped fish-bone for their
only toys. Hughey had already gone, nor
was he at his desk in the afternoon, when
his teacher and Nora looked vainly for
him; nor did he return to his lodgings
until after sundown. When he came, he
brought milk with him, earned by holding
a gentleman's horse at the Rotunda;
and with that and some boiled potatoes,
there was a feast. Hughey's vocation, it
would appear, had not yet declared itself.
He had haunted Stephen's Green and its
sumptuous purlieus in vain. He had
not been asked to join partners with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>
Messrs. Pim, nor to accept a Fellowship
at Trinity. The next day's, the next
month's history was no more heroic.
There were so many of those bright, delicate-featured,
ragged-shirted boys in Dublin,
coming about on foggy mornings
with propositions! The stout shop-keepers
were sated with the spectacle
of the unable and willing.</p>

<p>The days dragged. An affable policeman
who had known Hughey's mother
at home in New Ross, seeing him once
gazing in a junk-shop door, finally presented
him to the proprietor: "Toby,
allow me t' inthroduce a good lad wants
a dhrive at glory. Can ye tache um the
Black Art, now? He can turrun his
hand to most anythin', and his pomes,
Oi hear, do be grand, for his age."</p>

<p>The junk-man, good-naturedly scanning
Hughey, saw him burst into tears,
and beat the air, though the giant of the
law had passed on. That his chief and
most secret sin should be mentioned aloud,
to prejudice the world of commerce against
him, was horrible. His mother had told
on him! She must have found some lines
on Winny's slate last Sunday, entitled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>
<i>Drumalough: a Lament for the Fall of the
Three Kings, Written at Midnight.</i> Worra,
worra! Hughey was descended, on the
paternal side, through a succession of
ever-falling fortunes, from a good many
more than three kings, and used to wonder
where their crowns and sceptres were,
not that he might pawn them, either.
The O'Kinsellas were a powerful aboriginal
sept in the old days, and lived in
fortress castles, and playfully carried off
cattle and ladies from their neighbors of
the Pale. Malachi O'Kinsella's mother,
a heroine of romance who ran away with
a jockey lover, and never throve after,
was of pure Norman blood, and most
beautiful, with gray eyes, water-clear, like
Hughey's own, and the same bronze-colored
hair; and it was said she could
play the harp that soft it would draw
the hearing out of your head with ecstasy!
Now the junk-man was fatherly,
and presented Hughey, in default of a
situation, with a consolatory coin; but
foregoing events had been too trying for
the boy's nerves: he dropped it, and
fled, sobbing. He simply couldn't live
where his po'try was going to rise up<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>
against him, and wail like a Banshee in
the public ear. He charged, in his
wrath and grief, across the crowded
bridge, and down the line of quays east
of it, straight into a fat, gray-headed,
leather-aproned person directing a group
of sailors unloading a boat.</p>

<p>This person, sent of Heaven, with miraculous
suddenness, and with musical
distinctness, exclaimed: "'Aven't I been
a-wishin' of 'im, and directly 'e runs into
me harms! Crawl into that barrel, sonny,
and if you 'old it steady, I'll 'eave you
tuppence." Hughey, foreordained likewise,
crawled in. When he came out, Mr.
J. Everard Hoggett looked him over, from
his moribund hat to his slight patrician
ankle. "I likes a boy wot's 'andy, and
'as little to sy, like you." He resumed
critically, "'E don't appear to be from
any of 'Er Marjesty's carstles, 'e don't.
Perhaps 'e might like to 'ang about 'ere,
and earn three bob a week?" Hughey
hugged his twopenny piece, blushed,
trembled, twisted his legs in the brown
trousers too big for him, and replied in
gulps: "O sir! Yes, sir." Whereby
his annals begin.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>This perfectly amazing luck befell towards
the end of May. Mr. Hoggett,
going home, beckoned him, took him
into a little eating-house, sat him down,
paid for a huge order, and departed.
"There's a couple o' lion cubs hinside
wot ought to be your westcot, needs 'am
and heggs. Fill 'em full; and mind you
come to-morrow at a quarter to ight.
I'll 'ave no lyzy lubbers alongside o' me."
With which fierce farewell, and disdaining
thanks, Mr. Hoggett faded wholly
away.</p>

<p>Hughey, half-dazed, sat at a table
alone, sniffing celestial fragrances from
the rear, with the joy in his breast jumping
like a live creature in a box. To
quiet it, while he waited, he took up a
torn journal which was lying on the nearest
chair. At first, what he read seemed
to have no meaning, but when some
moments had passed, still odorous only,
and non-flavorous, Hughey's collected
and intelligent eye had taken in the dramatic
political crisis, the stocks, the African
news, the prospects of Irish literature,
and the latest London wife-beating. On
the advertisement page, one especial paragraph<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>
in sensational print rooted his attention.
This was it:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"SERVANTS AND APPRENTICES,
ATTENTION! Here is the best Chance of
your lives. It will Never come again. <i>Trade
with us, and you lay the</i> FOUNDATION <i>of
your</i> FORTUNE! With every sixpenny worth
of goods bought of us on any Saturday night,
we give a COUPON on the Ninth anti-Sassenach
Bank of Belfast. <i>Fifty of these</i> entitle
the Bearer at the end of the year to a gift of
TEN POUNDS IN GOLD!! Honesty
the best Policy our motto. Best Material at
Lowest Prices; come and see. <i>Do not Neglect
your own</i> <span class="smcap">Good</span>. McClutch &amp; Gullim, Linen-drapers,
No. 19&mdash; &mdash;&mdash; St."</p></blockquote>

<p>Hughey, the innocent prospective capitalist,
took a stubby pencil from the only
sound pocket in his habiliments, and began
to figure on the margin of the paper;
for he had an inspiration. "Mother
would be thundherin' rich!" was what
flashed into his mind. Before he had
done with his emergency arithmetic, ham
and eggs, with all their shining train,
were set before him. With them, he
gallantly swallowed his conscience, for
Hughey, like a nobler Roman before him,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>
was resolving to be gloriously false, and,
for piety's sake, to trade his soul. He
foresaw vaguely that he would not be allowed,
out of his royal wages of three
shillings, to spend full half every Saturday
night, at McClutch and Gullim's;
yet to do it was the imperative thing now,
and that he felt impelled to do it was his
own super-private business, and his warrant.
Therefore would he keep his
secret close, and make what excuse he
might. He could not even think of asking
advice; how should any one else be
able to realize how he must act towards
his mother? The angels had given her
into his hands; and he knew at last
what was to be done for her. She should
be rich and gay, and have a coach, perhaps,
like a real lady; and Danny should
have a goat, and a sash with stripes in it,
like the little twin Finnegans; and the
Misses Honora and Winifrid O'Kinsella
should walk abroad with parasols!
Proper man&oelig;uvring now would fetch
twenty-five pounds sterling next summer.
But he would hide away what he
bought, and never tell until the beatific
hour when his mother should have the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>
money, and the linen, and the truth about
them, all together!</p>

<p>Hughey went home in a series of
hops and whirls, like a kitten's. He
brought a flood of riotous sunshine in
with him. It was supper-time; the
children had each a ha'penny bun, and
some tea. Mrs. O'Kinsella was lying
down, with an ache between her lungs
and her spine, after a long day's lifting
and scrubbing. She felt the good news,
before the child spoke. "O mother!
'tis the most illigant thing's happened:
ye niver heard the loike." Hughey's
pale comely little face was radiant.</p>

<p>"Phwhere is ut, and phwhat d'ye get,
dear?" Then Hughey screwed up his
courage, and told his only, his masterly
lie: "North Wall, mother; and a shillin'
and six every week." "A shillin' and
six!" shrieked Nora. "O Hughey!"
But the critic for whose opinion he cared
was not quite so enraptured. She smiled,
and praised him, but took it too tamely,
her son thought. However, he reflected
that she little knew the felicities in store.</p>

<p>In the morning, his career began, and
it maintained itself with vigor, inasmuch<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>
as by the autumn he was of real value to
his employers. He had many duties
and some trusts. His orders all came
directly from the benevolent bluff Mr.
Hoggett, or from his mild reflection and
under-study, a small, bald, capable head-clerk
from the north, who was known
as Jibtopsails; for what reason, Hughey
could never divine, unless it was that his
ears were uncommonly large and flapping.
Jibtopsails sent him here and there with
parcels and messages, and he had been
faithful; he had made no grave mistake
yet, nor had he been unpunctual. But
every Saturday of his life saw him posing
as a purchaser at 19&mdash; &mdash;&mdash; Street, where
a hard-featured old woman, supposed
mother of the supposed junior partner,
served him always with the same ironically
deferent, "Good day, sir; and what
can I show you?" Jibtopsails inquired
occasionally after the health of Hughey's
family, particularly after Hughey had
told him that Mrs. O'Kinsella was not so
well as she used to be. For the rest, the
sympathy of that gentle cynic made the
child's blood run cold: he had such a
paralyzing fear that Jibtopsails might call<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>
there at the house, and talk to his mother,
and say something about three shillings
a week! Kind people in the parish, if
they knew, would bring her in wood, and
coal, and wine; but again, in the hallucination
of his jealous determined heart, the
boy prayed passionately that they might
not know, and that he alone should be the
deliverer. The dread of his secret being
found out, little by little made his life intolerable.
He had grown older since he
had that to cherish in his bosom, and it
seemed less delicious than while as yet it
was nothing but a dream.</p>

<p>His mother broke down, and could
toil no longer. Mrs. Drogan, who lived
downstairs, began to come up with her
mending, and sit between the bed and
the window. Nora was clever, for so
young a girl; but she stumbled a great
deal in her roomy charity boots, and had
to be scolded for awkwardness by Mrs.
Drogan, who had brought up sixteen
rebels, and was disposed to command.
As for Winny and Dan, they made a
noise, and therefore had to be exiled to
the street, foul and dangerous as it was,
almost all day, while the invalid slept the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>
sleep of utter exhaustion. It occurred
often to Hughey, and with increasing
force, that to secure a future good, he
was doing a very vicious wrong; that it
would be far better for his mother to
have the money now, to provide comforts
and make her well, than for her to
do without it now, and be too feeble in
consequence to enjoy it when it would
come, all in a lump. Heavy and sharp
was this dilemma to the little fellow, as he
labelled the great bales, or set Mr. Hoggett's
dusted ledgers back on their shelves.
"Phwhat ought I be doin'?" he would
groan aloud, when he was alone. If he
confessed to his mother, and handed over
hereafter the total of his wages, there was
an end to the big income sprouting and
budding wondrously at Belfast, the income
which would be hers yet, with ever
so little patience. But if he should not
confess, and, meanwhile, if she should not
recover,&mdash;what would all the world's
wealth be then to poor Hughey?</p>

<p>October was damp and dispiriting;
Mrs. O'Kinsella coughed more, but apparently
suffered little. Hughey still
brought her, week by week, his pittance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>
of a shilling and sixpence. Ill as she was,
her alert instinct divined that something
ailed him; she pitied him, and worried
about him, and kissed his tears away with a
blessing, very often. Doctor Nugent was
called in for the first time, one rainy
noon. He told Mrs. Drogan, laconically,
that his patient was going to die,
and stopped her gesture of remonstrance.
"Say nothing to those children of hers,"
he added, aside, on the threshold; "there
is no immediate need of it, and the eldest
looks melancholy enough without it."</p>

<p>But the eldest was at his elbow. With a
still ardor painful to see, he raised himself
close to the tall doctor, and whispered into
his ear. "Phwhat wud save me mother?
Wudn't money do it, MONEY?"
The boy looked so thrillingly, impressively
earnest that the doctor rose to the
occasion. "Perhaps! That is, a winter
in France or Italy might delay the
end. But dear me! how on earth&mdash;"
His voice wavered, and he hurried down.</p>

<p>On the way back to the office, Hughey
crossed Augier Street, and stalked into
McClutch and Gullim's. He had business
with the old woman, imminent business.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
Would the Ninth anti-Sassenach
Bank of Belfast advance half of an
annual interest? that is, would they allow
him, Hugh O'Kinsella of Dublin,
merchant's errand-boy, what was due on
his receipts of purchases up to date?
He found that circumstances over which
he had no control prevented his waiting
until May: please might he draw out the
eleven odd pounds now? The old woman
had recently had other queries of that
nature, which proved that the victims
were getting restless; that it would soon
be advisable, in short, to strike camp,
and betake herself and her nefarious concerns
to Leeds or Manchester. Her sourness
vented itself promptly on Hughey.
Decidedly, the Ninth anti-Sassenach Bank
would do nothing of the sort; it was
against the rules; it never advanced cash
except in case of death, when coupons
from McClutch and Gullim's would hold
good for a life-insurance policy to the
corpse's relatives. "And now g'long to
the divil wid ye, ye limb!" concluded
Mrs. Gullim, in a burst of vernacular
indignation.</p>

<p>Hughey fairly reeled out to the pavement,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>
with wheels humming in his brain,
and a large triangular rock, sharper than
knives and smeared with poison (a not
unfamiliar rock, of late), lodged in the
middle of his throat. As he turned
down the windy North Wall, among
the sleek cattle waiting for exportation,
and pushed open the warehouse door
by the Liffey, Jibtopsails took his pen
from behind his capacious ear, and peered
over his spectacles.</p>

<p>"<i>Cead mille failthe, Brian Boruihme!</i>
and how is the royal fam&mdash;&mdash;." He got
no further; the young face opposite was
so awry with the spirit's mortal anguish
that Jibtopsails was truly sorry he had
tried to be jocose. It was almost a first
offence.</p>

<p>And now, with much introspection,
and heart-searching, and resolve, Hughey's
tragedy gathered itself together. On
Sunday, after church, he had occasion
to go out of town. As he wished to
deal with Nora, he offered to give her a
ride on the tram: a species of entertainment
which she accepted with enthusiasm.
When they were at the end of
their route, they set forth on foot, up-hill,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>
over two miles of exquisite moorland, to
the house of the retired first mate of the
Grace Greeley, who was summoned by
the firm of Hoggett as witness in a lawsuit.
Nora was in her usual spirits, and
her brother tried to wait until they should
show signs of flagging. O the heavenly
freedom of the country! the pleasant
smell of damp leaves! But Hughey's
heart would not rise. As they passed
the sheep-folds, the pretty huddled creatures
made Nora laugh, standing still,
agape, in her blue faded frock; and he
grabbed her roughly by the arm, albeit
his sad forbearing tone was not rough.
"D'ye love me at all, Nora?"</p>

<p>"That Oi do, Hughey O'Kinsella;
and ye needn't be scrunchin' of me to
foind ut out."</p>

<p>"Nora!"</p>

<p>"Phwhat is ut?"</p>

<p>"There's somethin' Oi do be bound
to say to ye." A pause.</p>

<p>"Can ye keep a secret?"</p>

<p>"Shure, Oi can."</p>

<p>"'Tis turrible."</p>

<p>"Niver ye moind, Oi'll keep ut!"
said the loyal other.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>Hughey lifted his face to the sweet
blowy autumn afternoon, took breath,
and increased his pace. "Mother is
loike to be doyin' soon. Maybe ye
didn't hear o' that. But she cud live
a hunderd year if ut wasn't so cruel
poor we are. Oi've been a-thinkin'
wan reason of ut is she has too many
childher. 'Tis good little Rosy is with
the saints. Childher all eats and wears
clothes, and isn't much use. If mother
wasn't ill, there'd be nothin' the matther
wid me; we cud go on along, and
Oi'd have power to do the beautiful
things, Nora dear. Ye'd all be proud as
paycocks o' me whin next the cuckoo'll
be in the green bush down be the Barrow;
only mother wud be undher the
ground. So 'tis long before that Oi
must be doin' phwhat Oi'm meanin' to
do. Now's the toime for her to be
cured, and the toime for me to behave
the usefullest to her is to-morrow, just
afther Oi'm dead."</p>

<p>The younger child was bewildered,
over-awed. "May the Lorrud have
mercy upon your sowl, Hughey!" she
murmured with vague solemnity, taking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>
in the legendary word "dead" and nothing
else. Her light feet ran unevenly
beside his, up the slope and down the
hollow, and over stiles and pasture-walls,
bright with their withering vines. She
was all ear when her brother began again,
irrelevantly and more softly, on his tremendous
theme, so old now to his
thoughts that he was conscious of no
solecism in the abrupt utterance of it.
"Whin ye dhrown, ye niver look bad at
a wake. A man kilt in the battle looks
bad, but not a dhrowned man. 'Tis
grand to be a marthyr to your counthry;
howsomiver, the guns isn't convanient,
and Oi must hould to the wather. The
rest Oi can't tell, becaze ye're a woman,
and wudn't undhersthand; but there's
pounds and pince in ut, and 'tis the
foine thing intoirely for mother." He
turned upon her his most searching gaze.
"Ye'll be constant and koind to her,
now? Ye'll be runnin' and bringin' her
a chair, and takin' the beef out o' your
mouth for her as long as ye live?
(Shure Oi forgot there's goin' to be tons
o' beef for yez all.) Promus me, Nora."
She looked at him, and her wide blue<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>
eyes filled; and presently she sank down
all in a heap, her face in the grass, her
heels in the air. It looked like revolt;
but it was regret, or rather the utter
helplessness of either. The boy never
flinched. "Promus me, Nora." "Oh,
Oi do, brother Hughey, Oi do!" she
sobbed. He stood by her a moment,
then with firmness followed the path out
of sight, his slender withdrawing figure
significant against the sky.</p>

<p>When he came back, the anxious
Nora was on the road, whence she
could see far and wide. Little was said
as they returned home, through ways
thickening with cabs and passers-by.
But skirting Dean Swift's dark Cathedral,
they heard the treble voices at evensong
in the choir, and the grave sweetness
of Tallis' old music seemed to thaw
Hughey's blood. He drew his sister
closer as they walked, and bent his curls
over her. He had received a fresh illumination
since he spoke last.</p>

<p>"You're what mother needs," he whispered,
"and so's Dan, seein' he's no
bigger than a fairy. But Oi'd be betther
away, and so'd Winny, for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>
sake o' leavin' plenthy to eat and plenthy
o' room. Ye'll give me Winny in
her little coat whin Oi ax ye to-noight,
will ye, Nora?" The child glanced up
mournfully at her ruling genius, without
a word, but with a look of supernatural
submission. They went up the rickety
stairs, arm in arm.</p>

<p>Mrs. O'Kinsella, who had had a trying
day, had just said to Mrs. Drogan, rising
with a view to supper for her husband:
"Oi'm of that moind meself. Johanna
Carr'd be a widdy contint in her ould
age, if she'd had childher, if she'd had a
son loike Hughey. Me blessid darlint!
he's gould an' dimonds. By the grace
o' God Almighty, Oi cud bow me head
if He tuk the rest away from me, but
He cudn't part me and the bhoy, me
and the bhoy." She began to cough
again.</p>

<p>Her son asked to sit up late. "Oi'd
be writin', mother," he pleaded. Her
pride in him came to her poor thin
cheeks. "'Tis a Bard ye'll be yet,
loike the wans your father read about in
the histhory!" Hughey knew he had
been misunderstood; but trifles were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>
trifles, and must be ignored, now that
the hour of action had struck.</p>

<p>Having taken off his shoes, he sat down
in the broken chair by the table, with his
pencil, and the paper which Jibtopsails
had given him. The inmates of the room
were all unconscious in half an hour, except
himself and Nora. She, in a fever
of excitement, kept vigil, lying as usual
since consumption had come openly under
their roof, between Winny and the baby.
Winny, dirty, hungry, and tired out
with dancing to a hurdy-gurdy, had
fallen asleep in her clothes. Nora did
not require her to undress. These were
the three letters which Hughey wrote.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<i>Mr. Everard Hoggett, Limited.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>: Thank you for being kind to
me. I was fond of you. I hope you won't be
out of a boy long. There do be a very honest
boy named Mickey McGooley goes to my
school I used to go to. He has a iron foot,
but he is good-looking in the rest of him. I
think he would come if you asked him. Please
tell the other gentilmen I won't forget him
either.</p>


<p class="right">
<span class="indent">Your respeckful friend,</span><br />
<span class="smcap">Hugh</span>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span></p>

<blockquote>
<p><i>Ninth Anti-Sassenach Bank, Belfast, Ireland.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir</span>: My mother she is named Mrs. M.
O'Kinsella, will send you the papers from
McClutch and Gullim. As I will be dead you
pay my money please to her. I let you know
now so that it will be all rite. It began last
May 28th and stops Saturday, October 21st.
Yours truly, hoping you will send it soon,</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Mother</span>: You must cheer up and not
cough. You can go to France or somewhere.
You will find a heap of lengths of linen stuff in
a box under the steps of old Tom's shop. He
doesn't know about it. It is mine and the
nicest they is, and if you don't be wanting it,
you can sell it. Then you look in the lining
of Danny's cap, and find some bank papers,
and you send them to the Ninth anti-Sassenach
Bank in Belfast and it will send you nigh twelve
pound gold. You will find Winny and me by
Richmond Bridge, and it will not be so expencive
without us. I hope you won't be low for
me, for Nora says she will be good. Dear
mother, I dident know any other way to make
you happy and well at this present. Goodbye

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>After that laborious signature, he folded
and addressed the first two sheets, and
after a plunge into the recesses of his
pocket, stamped them. The last one he
slipped beneath his mother's pillow. He
looked at her wistfully, lying there on the
brink of all compensation, at last! She
turned over, and sighed feebly: "Go to
bed, Hughey dear." He did not dare
to kiss her, for fear she should become
wide awake. Back into the shadow he
shrank, and so remained a long time. A
dim sense of defeat stole over him, like
a draught through a crack, from a wind
which pushes vainly without. But he had
never in his life hugged any thought
whose interest centred in himself; and
immediately his whole being warmed
again with the remembrance that his defeat
meant victory for a life dearer to him
than his own. When the great bell outside
had struck two, he crept across the
room.</p>

<p>"Is she ready, Nora?"</p>

<p>"She is, Hughey."</p>

<p>He stooped to the floor, and gathered
the drowsy body in his arms. On the
landing, one floor below, the little sister<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>
cried aloud. "No, no, no, no!" he
crooned, in a passion of apprehension:
"Brother will show Winny the bright
moon."</p>

<p>They came safely to the street; the
moon indeed was there, flooding the
world with splendor. When Nora had
buttoned Winny's coat, and the boy had
posted his letters, they took her by either
hand, and started.</p>

<p>Hughey had planned out his difficult
campaign to the end, and his brain was
quiet and clear. Passing through Church
Street, he raised his hat with reverence,
as he had always done since he came to
Dublin, to a blank stone on the south
side in the ancient yard of Saint Michan's;
for under that stone, according to a tradition,
Robert Emmett's sentinel dust reposes.
There on the old Danish ground,
at the crisis, Winny's fiery Gaelic temper
came again to the fore. Struck with the
solitude and the dark, the dread faces of
unusual things, and jostled by the wind
which pounced at her from its corner lair
on the north bank of the river, she hung
back and rebelled. "Let me go, let me&mdash;go!
Hughey! Oh!..." The little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>
silver lisp arose in very real, in irresistible
alarm.</p>

<p>Never once, in all his mistaken planning,
had Hughey paused to consider
that she had a voice in the matter. If
she were unwilling to die for his dearest,
why, what right had he, Hughey,
though scornful and disappointed because
of it, to compel her? After all,
she was only seven, and silly! He
looked at Nora over the capped head
between them. Then he fetched a deep,
deep sigh, and the tears came to his eyelids,
burned, and dried.</p>

<p>They went on, ever slower; and at
Richmond Bridge Hughey spoke to
Winny, as he felt that he could do at
last, tenderly, and even with humorous
understanding. "Now 'tis the end o'
your walk, an' ye'll trot home wid Nora,
and niver moind me at all, dear. Some
day she'll be tellin' ye phwhat ye missed."
But to Nora herself he said softly:</p>

<p>"Take care o' mother, mavourneen."</p>

<p>"Oi will, Hughey."</p>

<p>She kissed him twice; her smooth
cheek against his was cold as a shell. He
made a gesture of dismissal, which she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>
did not disobey; and he watched them go,
without further sign. The two childish
figures were swallowed by the blue-black
shadows, and the pavement under their
naked feet gave forth no receding sounds.
Yet Hughey, bereft of them so quickly
and utterly, listened, listened, tiptoeing to
the central arch of the bridge.</p>

<p>The autumnal Sabbath breath of the
slumbering capital floated in a faint white
mist against the brick and stone. Every
high point was alive with light: the masts
in port, the roof of the King's Inns, the
Park, the top of the Nelson monument,
the Castle standard, the nigh summits
of the gracious Wicklow hills. Below
were the dim line of Liffey bridges, processional
to the sea, and the sad friendly
wash of the chilly water. Clear of any
regret or self-pity, he would have his farewell
grave and calm, and he would set out
with the sign of faith. So he knelt down,
in prayer, for a moment, and with his eyes
still closed, dropped forward.</p>

<p>In another eternal instant, he came
into the air. He had a confused sense of
being glad for Winny, and otherwise quite
satisfied and thankful. There, next the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>
wall, was a rotten abandoned raft, a chance
of life within clutch; he saw it, and
smiled. Then Hughey sank, and the
black ebb-tide took him.</p>

<p>Nora's knowledge, meanwhile, was too
torturing to be borne. No sooner had
she left her brother than she caught the
heavy little one into her slight arms, and
ran. Breathless, and choked with sorrow,
she told her mother all she knew,
and roused the Drogans, who in turn
called up the Smiths, the Fays, the Holahans,
the McCarthys. From right and
left the neighbors swarmed forth on a
vain and too familiar trail: the Spirit of
Poverty flying unmercifully ever to the
rescue of her own, she</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
&mdash;&mdash;"that would upon the rack of this rough world<br />
Stretch them out longer."
</p></blockquote>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Two of Hughey's letters had to go undelivered:
one belonging to a corporation
which never existed, and one to a heartbroken
woman who set sail for the Isles
of Healing, before the dawn.</p>

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic

"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
